        some research and came across a build called the blue lotus, which caught

        only $700. However, it's a couple years old, so I'm sure it's outdated at

        what to get and what to avoid. I'm on a tight budget, so I'm looking for something

        micro transaction system. I had bought the $60 game and then found out that
        I had to pay real money for an in-game currency that could only be used to
        buy loot boxes. It was even more annoying that there were DLC weapons that
        were only available in these loot boxes and that I had a very small chance
        of actually getting them. By the time the game stopped being supported by
        Treyarch, there were more DLC weapons than normal weapons in the base-game,

        a fun open-world RPG, but it seemed like everyone else was expecting something
        revolutionary. I thought it was unlikely that the game would live up to such
        high expectations, so I tried to warn people not to get too excited. I didn't
        think the game would be bad, but I thought it would be better to have realistic

        make a great protagonist if there was ever a sequel. I liked Rusty, but he
        seemed kind of lazy and unenthusiastic about his job. The other partner, whose
        name I couldn't remember, just rubbed me the wrong way. Bekowsky, on the other

        he would be a great choice to lead a new game. I imagined what it would be

    - summary: I thought Xbox needed to come up with better names for their consoles
      content: I was talking to someone about the new Xbox consoles, and I realized
        how confusing the names were. There was the Xbox One S, the Xbox Series X,
        the Xbox One X, and the Xbox Series S. It seemed like they were trying to
        confuse people, especially grandparents who were trying to buy a console for
        their kids. I thought it would be better if they came up with more distinct
        and memorable names. For example, I thought the Xbox Series X should have
        been called the Xbox Scorpio, because scorpions are cool and it would have
        been a more interesting name. I imagined how much easier it would be for people
        to understand the differences between the consoles if they had better names.

        case, all for an unknown price. I'm having trouble deciding which one is the
        better value, so I'd appreciate any advice or opinions.
    - summary: I'm considering buying a new GPU and need help deciding which one to
        get
      content: I've been contacted by an online shop owner who told me that 30 series
        GPUs are coming into stock soon. I'm excited, but the prices are higher than
        I expected. The 3060 ti is $450, the 3070 is $633, and the 3070 ti is $672.
        I want to get the most out of my money, and I don't plan on upgrading my GPU
        for at least 5 years. I'm considering getting a Dell Optiplex with an i5 9500
        or 10500 processor and changing the power supply to add the new GPU. I'd appreciate
        any help or advice on which GPU to choose.
    - summary: I'm planning to buy a new monitor and need help deciding on the resolution
      content: I'm planning to buy a new PC with a 9500 processor and a 3060 ti graphics
        card, and I'm not sure what monitor resolution to get. I'm considering getting
        a 1080p 75hz monitor for now, and then upgrading to a 4k monitor in the future.
        I think 1080p will be enough for at least 2 years, and 4k monitors will likely
        be cheaper by then. I've found a 1080p 75hz monitor for $130, and a 4k 60hz
        monitor for $235. I'm planning to get the 1080p monitor and upgrade to 4k
        in the future, but I'd appreciate any advice or opinions on this decision.
    - summary: I want to build a cheap PC using modern components
      content: I've been thinking about building a cheap PC using modern components,
        but I'm not sure where to start. I've considered using a 10$ Xeon processor,
        but I realized that the motherboard would cost around $100, which would ruin
        the possibility of building a budget PC. I'm looking for advice on what the
        cheapest and most modern PC I could build would be. I've considered using
        an 10100f processor and an h410 motherboard, but I'd appreciate any other
        suggestions or opinions.
    - summary: I'm building a $700 PC and need help choosing components
      content: I'm building a $700 PC and I'm having trouble deciding which components
        to choose. I've considered getting an i9 10900 processor, but I think it might
        be overkill for what I need. I've currently got a 5600G processor, a B550M
        PRO VDH WIFI motherboard, 16GB of RAM, a 480GB SSD, and a 650W power supply.
        I'd appreciate any advice or opinions on whether I should stick with my current
        build or make any changes.

      content: I've always wanted to learn how to build a PC, but I don't want to
        spend too much money. I'm looking for a way to build a PC using modern components
        without breaking the bank. I've considered building a PC with a 1500x processor
        and a gt 1030 graphics card, but I'm not sure if that's the best option. I'd
        appreciate any advice or guidance on how to build a PC on a budget.

    - summary: I am struggling with acne and dermatologist issues
      content: I have been dealing with acne for a long time and it has been a huge
        challenge for me. I went to see a dermatologist a few years ago and they did
        a laser treatment that helped for a while, but now my acne is back and it's
        worse than ever. I have tried different products and treatments, but nothing
        seems to be working. My dermatologist is not willing to prescribe me the medication
        I want, such as Retin A, and instead wants me to do another expensive laser
        treatment. I am feeling desperate and frustrated, and I don't know what to
        do. I have also been experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression because
        of my acne, and it's affecting my daily life. I am looking for a new dermatologist
        who can help me find a solution to my acne problems.
    - summary: I am trying to stop picking at my acne
      content: I have been picking at my acne for years, and it's become a compulsive
        habit for me. Even though my skin is mostly clear now, I still find myself
        picking at every little blackhead or imperfection. It's like I dare myself
        to do it, and then I feel defeated and ashamed afterwards. I have tried to
        stop, but it's hard for me to resist the urge. I have been using Vitamin C
        serums and Retin A to try and fade the scabs and imperfections, but it's not
        working as well as I had hoped. I am feeling really frustrated and helpless,
        and I don't know how to break this habit. I have been trying to take care
        of my skin and use good products, but it's hard when I keep sabotaging myself
        by picking at my acne.
    - summary: I am looking for a new wallet for my significant other
      content: I want to buy a leather wallet for my significant other's birthday,
        and I am having a hard time finding the perfect one. He wants a wallet with
        a coin pouch, but I haven't been able to find one that meets his requirements.
        I have looked at several different options, including Tanner Goods, but none
        of them seem to be quite right. I am looking for a wallet that is made of
        high-quality leather and has a classic design. I don't want to spend too much
        money, so I am trying to find something that is under $100. I am hoping that
        someone can recommend a good option for me.
    - summary: I am trying to prepare for a Skype interview
      content: I have a Skype interview for a research position at a prestigious institution,
        and I am trying to prepare as much as possible. The interview is only 15 minutes
        long, so I want to make a good impression right away. I have been reading
        about what to wear and how to present myself, and I am trying to decide on
        an outfit. I don't want to be too trendy, but I also don't want to look too
        boring. I am considering wearing a navy blue dress or a light grey button-up
        shirt, but I am not sure what would be best. I am also wondering if I should
        wear a blazer or not, since it's summer. I want to come across as professional
        and capable, and I hope that I can make a good impression despite the short
        amount of time.
    - summary: I am looking for prescription creams for my sensitive skin
      content: I have extremely sensitive and acne-prone skin, and I am having a hard
        time finding products that don't clog my pores. I have tried almost everything,
        from high-end skincare products to natural oils, but nothing seems to work
        for me. I am currently using a very simple routine that includes zinc soap,
        rosewater spray, and a Vitamin C serum, and it's been helping to clear up
        my acne. However, I would like to be able to wear a cream at night and use
        sunscreen, but I haven't been able to find any products that don't break me
        out. I am hoping to find a prescription cream that can help my skin, and I
        am planning to talk to my GP about it. I am frustrated and disappointed that
        I haven't been able to find any products that work for me, and I hope that
        I can find a solution soon.

    - summary: I compared League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth
      content: I downloaded League of Legends on a whim and totally fell in love with
        it. I never played DotA, but I poked at the demo for Demigod and liked the
        concept, but hated the execution. LoL really appeals to me - I like that it's
        ala carte - I can cough up $3 or $5 at a time. I like the gameplay and the
        community, people have been really helpful and supportive. I spent a lot of
        time on the wiki getting better and understanding the game's finer points.
        I was wondering what makes Heroes of Newerth so great and why people are buzzing
        about it. After researching, I found that HoN is for competitive people who
        thrive on belittling other people and investing insane hours into video games,
        whereas LoL is for people who just like to chill out and have fun.
    - summary: I worked in food marketing at a peanut butter company
      content: I used to work for a company called Peanut Butter & Co. as a Food Marketing
        dude. They sell peanut butter in 10 flavors. When I worked there, there were
        only about 10 full-time employees, so it was still very much a DIY shop. I
        have experience with the world of food marketing, which is way more cut-throat
        and intense than people think. I'm happy to answer any questions about food
        marketing, but I won't discuss any projects that were under development that
        haven't been released.

        kitchen pantry. I'm starting from scratch, so I need some recommendations
        on what tools to get and how much to pay for them. I'm considering a Drill
        + Circular Saw combo from Home Depot, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
        I'd love to hear some advice from experienced DIY enthusiasts.
    - summary: I needed a custom suit for my wedding

        quality and price. I've already decided on the color and sizing, but I'm trying

    - summary: I dyed fabric for outdoor use

        to match our outdoor decor. The cushions are 100% cotton, and I was wondering
        if I could use standard fabric dye like RIT. I'm in LA, so rain isn't a regular
        concern, but I'm worried about the morning dew. I'd love to hear some advice
        on how to dye the fabric and what special concerns I should be aware of.
    - summary: I searched for the right credit card

        both have good credit and we budget strictly, but we're not sure what the
        best credit card is for us. We're considering the Amazon Prime card because
        we shop at Whole Foods and we're expecting a baby, so we think we'll be using
        Amazon more often. We're also considering the Chase Sapphire Rewards card,
        but we're not sure what the best option is. We'd love to hear some opinions
        and recommendations from people who have experience with different credit
        cards.

    - summary: I am looking for a specific type of android game
      content: I have been searching for a specific type of android game that I used
        to play back in the days of flash games. I remember how the games worked -
        you were given a countdown to build a base and set up defenses, and at the
        end of that countdown, waves of enemies would attempt to destroy your base.
        If you survived, the cycle would repeat until you lost. I have no clue what
        the genre is called, but I'm hoping someone can help me find it again. I've
        been trying to figure out what it's called, but so far, no luck. I'm really
        craving to play a game like that again, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

        which currently amount to $15k, in order to save up for a house as quickly
        as possible. I've already maxed out my IRA contributions and have some experience
        investing in government bonds through the treasury. Now, I'm looking for advice
        on how to invest my savings in a way that's safe and can generate extra income
        quickly. I'm eager to make the most of my new financial situation and set
        myself up for long-term financial stability.
    - summary: I am looking for a game similar to Antichamber

        unique mechanics and I'm now looking for more games like it. Unfortunately,
        I don't know of any other games that are remotely similar, so I'm reaching
        out for recommendations. I'm hoping to find a game that will provide a similar

        that's relevant to my region. I'm interested in learning more about when to
        plant, how to maintain good soil quality, and other general tips for creating

    - summary: I am trying to understand the consensus on Kickstarter clothes
      content: I have come across a discussion about Kickstarter clothes, but it's
        four months old, so I am curious to know what people think about them now.
        From what I see, Kickstarter clothes seem to offer good quality and reasonable
        prices, and some of them look pretty interesting. For example, one Kickstarter
        project allows you to provide your measurements, such as arm length, chest
        size, and waist size, to get a well-fit shirt. They also claim to have good
        quality and stitching, but the price is $80, which makes me wonder if it's
        worth it. I could probably get an old but good quality shirt on eBay and get
        it tailored for the same price.
    - summary: I am confused about the requirements to qualify for an HSA
      content: I am trying to understand the conditions I need to satisfy to be able
        to use a Health Savings Account (HSA). I think I understand the minimum deductible
        requirement, which is $1,300 for singles in 2016, and my plan meets this requirement
        with a deductible of $2,000. However, I am unsure about the 'HDHP maximum
        out-of-pocket amounts requirement'. Do I need to be above or below the threshold
        of $6,550? My plan has an out-of-pocket limit of $6,600, which is only $50
        away from the limit. I am worried that if my plan changes and the out-of-pocket
        limit increases, I will no longer be eligible for an HSA. I am also unsure
        about what happens if I am no longer eligible - can I still contribute to
        the HSA or take out funds to pay for medical expenses?
    - summary: I am looking for a good tailor for a custom suit in NYC

        found Black Lapel, but I have heard mixed reviews about their staff being
        too pushy. I am looking for a tailor who can take my measurements in person,
        rather than relying on self-measurements. I have a unique body type, being
        6 foot 1 inch and 168 pounds, with large calves and thighs, which makes it
        difficult for me to find off-the-rack suits that fit well. I am looking for
        a tailor who can create a suit that fits me perfectly, and I am willing to
        pay a premium for it.
    - summary: I am trying to submit a claim to Equifax despite their tool saying
        I was not impacted
      content: I was a victim of identity theft a few months ago, and I spent many
        hours dealing with the aftermath, including closing fraudulent accounts and
        setting up credit freezes. When I tried to submit a claim to Equifax, their
        tool said that my information was not affected by the breach, which I find
        hard to believe. I am trying to figure out if I can still submit a claim despite
        this, and if so, what documentation I need to provide. I kept records of the
        time I spent dealing with the identity theft, including dates and details
        of my conversations with banks, and I hope this will be sufficient to support
        my claim.
    - summary: I am considering rolling over my 401k to a Traditional IRA
      content: I have a Simple IRA with Fidelity, which offers great ETFs with low

        I also have a Traditional 401k with Betterment, which has a total funds fee
        and doesn't allow me to allocate my funds as I wish. I am considering rolling
        over my 401k to a Traditional IRA, but I am unsure about the pros and cons
        of doing so. I am concerned about losing the ability to make hardship withdrawals
        or loans against my 401k, as well as the potential impact on my bankruptcy
        protections. I am looking for advice on whether to move my funds to a Traditional
        IRA or keep them in my 401k.

    - summary: I am trying to lose weight and see my abs
      content: I started dieting about 2 months ago at 230 pounds and started T25
        a little over 3 weeks ago. I'm now down to 195 pounds. I'm wondering if I
        need to keep cutting and working out or just maintain and work out to see
        my abs. I've been working out about 5 times a week and my goal is to have
        visible abs and some tone in my chest, legs, and other places. I'm 6'2 and
        25 years old, and I've lost about 40 pounds in 5 months. When I stand up,
        my stomach looks fine and I can almost see the outline of my abs, but when
        I bend over, there are still rolls. I'm not sure if I need to lose more weight
        or gain more muscle in that area to tone it.
    - summary: I am unsure whether to focus on cardio or lifting to achieve my goal
        of visible abs
      content: I've been hitting the gym about 3 to 4 times a week, lifting, working
        abs, and doing light cardio. I also work abs one or two of the other days.
        My current goal is to have visible abs for summer and then work on other areas
        once I have achieved that. I'm wondering if just doing cardio, more than I
        do after workouts, would get me to my goal quicker than my current program.
        I can sometimes see my abs, so I'm fairly close. I'm 25 years old, 6'2, and
        190 pounds, and I've been dieting for about 2 months, eating 1500 to 1800
        calories plus some of the calories I burn from cardio.
    - summary: I am searching for an old game from the 90s where you play as a god

        wasn't a PC game. In the game, I remember building cities, but if you were
        gone too long, they'd get mad and burn them, or someone would come and burn
        them. A friend that I played it with just asked me if I remembered it, and
        now it's driving us both crazy trying to figure out what the game was. I've
        been thinking about it a lot, trying to remember any details that might help
        me identify the game.
    - summary: I am looking for a dumbbell only workout plan due to limited gym access
      content: I'm stuck moving motels a lot with no gym, but the ones I stay at have
        dumbbells. I was wondering if anyone has seen results with dumbbell-only workout
        plans. I'm debating between doing a 3-day plan or a 5-day plan where I work
        arms, chest, back, shoulders, and legs. The 5-day plan would only have about
        5 or so things I could do each day, and I would do 4 sets of 8 of each of
        them. I'm looking for opinions or success stories from people who have used
        dumbbell-only plans. I'm trying to find a way to stay on track with my fitness
        goals despite the challenges of constantly moving.
    - summary: I have experienced an increase in hunger despite losing weight
      content: I've been watching what I eat and eating around 2000 calories a day.
        I don't strictly track them because I know I'm well under my TDEE, and I'm
        not in a rush to drop weight fast. I'm 6'1 and have gone down under 200 from
        220. I eat roughly the same calories as I did when I started the diet. I work
        out 6 or 7 times a week, whether that's 30-45 minutes of weights or just treadmill
        time. I'm eating 50g of protein for breakfast alone, so I don't think protein
        is a problem. I'm definitely more hungry now than when I started the diet,
        and I'm curious why that is. I've lost 20 pounds, and my appetite has increased,
        which seems counterintuitive. I'm wondering if it's because my muscle requires
        more energy to maintain.
    - summary: I need help expanding my workout routine to include more exercises
      content: I'm currently doing the Dumbbell stopgap PPL from the wiki, but I'm
        going to be using it for more than the short term. I've already been on it
        for 3 months, but I'd like to add more than 4 or 5 workouts a day. I have
        dumbbells from 10-50 pounds in 5-pound increments, and I also have a cable
        machine. I feel like adding in some different exercises would help speed up
        my gains. I'm looking for advice on how to expand my routine and include more
        variety in my workouts. I want to make sure I'm challenging myself and making
        progress towards my fitness goals.
    - summary: I am preparing to attempt a new personal record in my workout
      content: I'm trying to figure out the best way to prepare for attempting a new
        max in my workout. I'm wondering what everyone's routine is leading up to
        attempting a new PR. Do you rest the muscle group the day before, or do you
        carb up all day and take extra protein or pre-workout supplements? How is
        your warm-up routine? Do you use light weights to get loose and then go for
        it, or do you slowly work up to the weight? I'm looking for advice on how
        to prepare myself for a successful attempt at a new personal record. I want
        to make sure I'm doing everything I can to set myself up for success.
    - summary: I am considering a 2-day rotation workout schedule
      content: I've seen schedules set up for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday,
        with splits working a single muscle group just once a week. I'm thinking about
        trying a split of chest and legs one day, and back and arms the second day,
        with accessory work each day. I'd rest on the third day and repeat. My chest
        and leg day would include bench, squats, and accessory work, while my back
        and arms day would include deadlift, curls, and more accessory work. I'd fit
        in abs every day and mix in shoulders both days as well. I'm wondering if
        this schedule would be effective and if anyone has any experience with a similar
        routine. I'm trying to find a way to balance my workout routine with my busy
        schedule.

    - summary: I met a girl while drinking and want to text her
      content: I met this girl last week while out drinking and we talked for a little.
        She asked for my number then we got separated. I haven't texted her or anything.
        That was a week ago and I want to text her but not sure what to say. I'm really
        bad at forming friendships with girls. I don't have any friends that are girls
        so I don't really know what to do. Is it weird to text someone out of the
        blue a week later? I've been thinking about her and I'm not sure how to approach
        the situation.
    - summary: I learned the importance of eye contact in conversations
      content: I've been having trouble keeping conversations going and I realized
        that it's because I'm not making enough eye contact. When the other person
        is talking, I should look at them to get the information of how the conversation
        is going, what they're saying, and how they're feeling. If I don't look at
        them, I'm not gathering all the information of the conversation, and I can
        easily let my thoughts go to other places. It's hard at first, but it will
        get easier and more natural the more I do it. I've been practicing and I can
        already see the difference it makes.
    - summary: I got a girl's number in class but don't know what to do next
      content: I asked for this girl's number in class because we were both kinda
        lost in class. We didn't really talk much about other than class, but I texted
        her about some homework and we talked a bit about it. Then she texted me the
        next day asking something about the class. I'm not sure how to get to know
        her more, we've only talked about the class and I don't know anything more
        about her. I want to keep the conversation going, but I'm not sure what to
        say or do next.
    - summary: I struggle to make friends and want to improve my social skills
      content: I'm in my second year in college and I don't really have anyone I'd
        call a friend. I know people and talk to people and meet people, but never
        hang out with people. A lot of people are always texting and chatting, but
        I don't text or chat with anybody. I just want friends that I can talk to,
        especially a girlfriend, and talk about random stuff a lot. But I have no
        idea how to get to that point. I feel like I'm missing out on something and
        I want to improve my social skills to make friends and connections.
    - summary: I've become more confident after practicing eye contact
      content: Since I've learned the importance of eye contact, I've gotten way more
        confident. I'm able to speak to random people way easier. I've made more acquaintances
        and I can think of things to say easier. I can keep the conversation flowing
        better and I know when someone doesn't want to talk. I know when someone is
        engaged in the conversation and I'm more socially aware. I'm more relaxed
        in social settings and I feel like I can be myself. It's amazing how something
        as simple as eye contact can make such a big difference in my life.
    - summary: I'm unsure what to do with a girl's number after getting it
      content: I always get people's numbers and then wait too long to text them.
        I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. For example, I got a girl's number
        at a club meeting and now it's Saturday and I'm not sure what I should be
        saying. We kinda talked about hiking and she said she hasn't gone a lot, so
        I'm thinking of somehow asking her to go hiking. But I don't want to come
        on too strong or seem weird. I just want to keep the conversation going and
        get to know her better.
    - summary: I'm trying to stop trying too hard to get friends or a girlfriend
      content: I don't mean stop trying as in stop talking to people, but talk to
        everybody even if I have no interest in being their friend. I never know where
        it could lead to or I could be more similar than I thought. Just talking to
        people with the intent of having fun or learning something, not with the intent
        of being friends or getting a girlfriend. I feel like I've been putting too
        much pressure on myself to make friends or find a girlfriend, and it's not
        working. So I'm trying to take a step back and just enjoy the conversations
        and see where they go.
    - summary: I'm learning to improve my social skills by embracing mistakes
      content: I want to become better at socializing and I know that I'll have to
        mess up in order to grow. It's like the concept of yin and yang, where opposite
        forces are necessary for improvement. If I want to learn to drive, I'll have
        to make mistakes and correct them. It's the same with socializing. I'll have
        to try new things, take risks, and learn from my mistakes. It's not always
        easy, but I know it's necessary if I want to improve. I'm trying to be more
        open to new experiences and not be too hard on myself when I make mistakes.
    - summary: I'm trying to make my room a reflection of my personality
      content: I heard that making my room look as best as possible can build confidence,
        so I'm trying to do that. I'm putting up posters, objects, and art that reflect
        my personality and interests. It's hard to design a cool room, but I'm trying
        to have fun with it. I'm not looking at other pictures of rooms for inspiration,
        I'm just trying to find my own style. I'm using brighter colors and trying
        to make the room feel cozy and inviting. It's a work in progress, but I'm
        excited to see how it turns out.
    - summary: I'm unsure if a hangout with a girl was a date or not
      content: I went to a girl's house to draw and work on homework, but we ended
        up just talking and stuff. The whole time I didn't know if it was a date or
        not, which made things pretty awkward at times. It went pretty bad, I feel
        like. I'm not sure what to do in situations like this, I don't want to assume
        it's a date if it's not, but at the same time, I don't want to miss an opportunity.
        I wish I could just ask her what she thought, but that seems too awkward.
    - summary: I'm struggling to build a relationship with a girl I like
      content: There's a girl I like and we've hung out twice. She seems like she's
        into me, but I'm pretty shy and have a hard time showing interest back. Especially
        being physical. I don't know how to show interest and I feel like I make it
        seem like I'm not interested in dating her. I've never had a girlfriend, so
        I don't even get how dating or becoming girlfriend/boyfriend works. I feel
        like I'm messing everything up and I don't know how to fix it.
    - summary: I'm trying to improve my knowledge of history
      content: I never was good at history classes in middle school and high school
        and never really tried in them. Now I'm in college and my knowledge of history
        and current events is embarrassing. I couldn't tell you the most common questions
        that everybody knows. I want to fix this, because I'm starting to find it
        interesting. I just know nothing about it and it's hard to learn. I'm not
        sure where to start or how to make it more engaging, but I'm willing to try.
    - summary: I'm unsure how to keep a girl's interest after she kissed me
      content: This girl from my class and I have hung out 3 times. I've known her
        for a little over a month. The last time she kissed me at the end, but then
        she already had plans when I asked her out a couple days ago. I've never had
        a girlfriend before, so I'm pretty lost. Where do I go from here? I feel like
        I already messed up by making it seem like I'm not interested, but that could
        be wrong. I try to make it seem like I'm interested, but I'm pretty shy, so
        I think it comes off as if I'm not.
    - summary: I'm trying to be a nicer and more approachable person
      content: I really don't know if I'm just overthinking this, but I feel like
        I come off as not liking other people because sometimes I'm so quiet and get
        anxious. Even super simple things, like sometimes if someone says hi to me,
        I'll just kind of freeze up and nod my head instead of saying anything. I'm
        probably just overthinking this, but I want to be a nicer and more approachable
        person. I want people to feel comfortable around me and I want to be able
        to make friends easily.
    - summary: I'm unsure if a girl is interested in me or not
      content: I'm horrible at the whole dating thing and this is actually the first
        girl I've gone on a date with. I don't really know how to build a relationship.
        But this girl in my class seemed interested before and we hung out 3 times.
        The third time she kissed me, but after that, I think I kind of messed up.
        I feel like I didn't really show too much interest and sorta started acting
        awkward sometimes. Then I asked her to hang out like 3 times in a couple days,
        which probably seemed a bit clingy. And then in class, I seemed kind of cold
        to her by accident because of my shyness. I kept messing up and losing easy
        opportunities to be with her, and trying to make opportunities that didn't
        make sense. I honestly don't know where I stand anymore.
    - summary: I'm hesitant to use Tinder to meet girls
      content: It's hard for me to meet girls or people in general, but I don't know
        if I'd like the idea of finding someone from Tinder. I know not everybody
        just uses it for hookups, but still, if I did find somebody that I actually
        liked, I feel like the fact that I met them through Tinder would make me a
        bit worried. I'm not sure what to think about it, part of me wants to try
        it out, but another part of me is hesitant. I don't want to be judged or have
        people think that I'm only looking for hookups.

    - summary: I am trying to get fit and slim down
      content: I've recently noticed that my belly has grown and I'm now determined
        to get rid of it. As a 24-year-old vegetarian, I'm looking to create a calorie
        deficit to lose weight. I've been researching and trying to understand the
        best approach, considering my dietary restrictions and the need for sufficient
        protein intake. I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly, so I've been reading
        up on calorie counting and exercise routines. My goal is to remove the excess
        fat around my stomach area and get fit, but I'm not sure if it's as simple
        as just counting calories and exercising more. I'm eager to start my fitness
        journey, but I want to make sure I have the right information before I begin.
    - summary: I am struggling with calorie counting
      content: I've just started using a calorie counting app and I'm trying to understand
        how it works. As a 24-year-old, 5'7
    - summary: I am seeking advice on my fitness goals
      content: I've been vocal about my fitness goals and my friends and family are
        starting to worry that I'm becoming too obsessed. I'm a 26-year-old male,
        5'6
    - summary: I am looking for a 3-day workout routine
      content: I'm looking for a 3-day workout routine to do on Monday, Wednesday,
        and Friday, while also running the C25K program on alternate days. I've read
        the wiki, but it seems to focus more on 4 or 5-day routines. I've found a
        Reddit post with a decent program, but I'm not sure if it's better than the
        Boring But Big routine. I'm trying to bulk up, as I'm currently 60kg at 5'5
    - summary: I am reflecting on the importance of developer and producer relationships
      content: I've been thinking about the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077 and how
        it highlights the importance of a good working relationship between developers
        and producers. The game's poor reception and numerous bugs have damaged the
        reputation of the developer, CD Projekt Red. I believe that this is a result
        of novice decisions, such as showing only perfect, non-buggy cinematic trailers
        and only allowing reviewers to play the PC version. This experience has put
        other game development failures into perspective, such as No Man's Sky and
        the ending of Mass Effect 3. I think it's a reminder that even well-established
        developers can make mistakes, and that a good relationship between devs and
        producers is crucial for a game's success. Games like RDR2 and Horizon Zero
        Dawn have shown that it's possible to create incredible, living worlds, but
        it requires careful planning and collaboration.

    - summary: I almost died on 11 September 2001 at the Twin Towers
      content: I almost died on 11 September 2001 at the Twin Towers. I was there
        when the towers fell, and it was a terrifying experience. Thousands of people
        burned alive, and we still don't know the truth of what happened. As I was
        running from the World Trade Center, I realized how short life is. I was blessed
        to survive, but 3000 people died, and 100,000 family members have suffered
        for 20 years. My love and heart go to the family members. I remember the chaos
        and the fear that gripped everyone's hearts. It was a day that changed my
        life forever, and I will never forget the sacrifices of the firefighters and
        victims.
    - summary: I was friends with Stan Lee and Michael Jackson
      content: I was honored to have Stan Lee as my partner, close friend, and manager
        for over 10 years. We had well over 1000 dinners together, and I took Michael
        Jackson to his house once. Stan and Michael were amazing human beings, and
        they loved each other. Stan was the greatest storyteller in history, and Michael
        was a sensitive artist. I have many fond memories of our time together, and
        I will always cherish them. Stan created Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man, Thor,
        Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Panther, and 590 characters for Marvel. He was a genius,
        and his legacy will live on forever.
    - summary: I interviewed 400 officials for my book and film about Marilyn Monroe
      content: I interviewed 400 officials for over 25 years for my book and film
        about Marilyn Monroe. Many unpublished photos, footage, and interviews will
        be revealed in my documentary. I believe that Marilyn Monroe did not commit
        suicide, nor was it accidental. She was murdered, and the truth will come
        out. The fake news media spread every lie in the world about her, but I am
        determined to uncover the truth. My documentary will have shocking unpublished
        photos, footage, facts, and interviews never before seen or heard.
    - summary: I defend Michael Jackson's innocence
      content: I believe that Michael Jackson was murdered, and he did not kill himself
        nor was it an accident. Dr. Murray was charged with manslaughter and went
        to jail, but the real truth has not been told yet. The people who killed MJ
        are walking free with millions of dollars, and nobody is trying to stop them.
        I have had many lunch and dinners with his family members, and I always defend
        Joe Jackson, who most fans hate. Michael was a sensitive artist, but Joe had
        to protect his little kids in the 1950s when they were burning blacks alive
        and lynching them. Joe protected his family perfectly, and I will always defend
        him.
    - summary: I was affected by the death of my pet Mr. Gorgeous
      content: My beautiful angel, Mr. Gorgeous, who I loved so much, passed away.
        He was the most loving, kind, loyal, elegant person I ever knew. Better than
        most humans, he was old, but attacked by a person who severely injured him
        to steal his feathers. I love him forever, and his death has left a void in
        my heart. I will always remember his loving nature and the joy he brought
        to my life.

    - summary: I helped a girl from rural Afghanistan pursue higher education
      content: I remember when Afghanistan fell, I promised myself to make sure we
        continue supporting girls in STEM on a graduate level. Now that the world
        wouldn’t care about girls in STEM in Afghanistan, we started with a high school
        graduate. She was selected to continue her studies at a private med school.
        I was thrilled to see her progress and was grateful to those who donated to
        make this possible. After just four months into our program, I was amazed
        at her growth and couldn't believe that my efforts to force digital learning
        into the curriculum had paid off. It was a moment of pure joy and a testament
        to the fact that when you invest in girls, it pays off.
    - summary: I witnessed the devastating effects of the Taliban's collapse of public
        healthcare
      content: I saw children starving and their mothers waiting to receive a meal,
        a mother and a girl waiting to receive two months worth of groceries in cold
        weather. The Taliban forced a collapse of public healthcare and our kids suffered,
        starved, and the President made sure they continued to starve no matter what.
        It was heartbreaking to see the desperation in their eyes and the struggle
        to survive. The image of those mothers and children is still etched in my
        mind, a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of the Taliban's actions.
    - summary: I collaborated with an organization to deliver aid to malnourished
        babies
      content: I worked with 2young2wed to deliver packages to the last 30 families
        whose babies were severely malnourished. These packages helped with food that
        assisted women in producing milk and feeding their babies. Because it's the
        mother that is starving, that's why the child starves. I was grateful to be
        a part of this effort and to see the impact it had on the lives of these families.
        It was a small step towards making a difference, but it was a crucial one.
    - summary: I was honored to receive an award for my work with LEARNAfg
      content: I was so honored to be one of the 6 laureates/winners for the Activists
        Summit 2022. I was awarded this Prize for my work at LEARNAfg. LEARN had been
        able to expand to 4 provinces in Afghanistan, and we had girls in Kandahar,
        Bamyan, Takhar, and Kabul attending. It was a moment of pride and recognition
        for the hard work and dedication that had gone into making LEARNAfg a success.
        I was grateful for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of these
        girls and to be acknowledged for my efforts.
    - summary: I celebrated the graduation of my students in the best way possible
      content: So every class when they graduate, we celebrate it in the best way
        possible. When I was back in Kandahar, we would get together on a specific
        day, put on our best dresses, bring cake and everything that the girls wanted.
        And then we would celebrate. It would be our yearly parties. I loved seeing
        the smiles on their faces and the sense of accomplishment in their eyes. It
        was a moment of pure joy and a celebration of their hard work and dedication.
    - summary: I was invited to share my story at the University of St Catherine
      content: I would like to thank the University of St Catherine for inviting me
        and letting me share the stage with Roya Mahboob. I was so grateful for the
        amazing opportunity to be able to talk about the Women of Color Leadership
        series. I was also able to meet newly resettled Afghans and young students,
        and it was a great experience to connect with them and share my story. It
        was a moment of pride and a chance to inspire others with my journey.

    - summary: I was amazed by Kelly Jones' flawless singing at a gig
      content: I have been to a lot of gigs, in fact I’ve sung at a lot of gigs, but
        never have I heard a more flawless singer than Kelly Jones. It was a truly
        unforgettable experience that left me in awe. I felt so lucky to have grown
        up in the U.K in the 90s, surrounded by such amazing bands and talented musicians.
        As I listened to Kelly Jones sing, I couldn't help but think about how fortunate
        I was to have been a part of that era. The music of the 90s has always held
        a special place in my heart, and Kelly Jones' performance only reinforced
        that feeling.
    - summary: Our singer was inspired by a unique figure
      content: Our singer trained one summer and had to give speeches about who inspired
        them to perform. I remember Lee saying that he was inspired by a wrestler
        who played 3 different characters, which was not a typical response as most
        people usually cited Oscar-winning performers. This unusual inspiration has
        always stuck with me, and I find it fascinating to think about how different
        people can draw inspiration from such unique sources. It's a testament to
        the diversity of human experience and the many different paths that can lead
        to creativity and passion.
    - summary: I enjoyed a mix of artists and felt inspired
      content: I listened to a great mix of artists and felt so inspired that I spent
        the rest of the day dreaming about them. The music was like a breath of fresh
        air, and it transported me to a different world. As I listened, I felt my
        imagination running wild, and I couldn't help but think about all the possibilities
        that music holds. It was a truly uplifting experience, and I felt grateful
        to have had the chance to enjoy such wonderful artistry.
    - summary: I appreciated a song that sounded like a dream
      content: I was listening to broken_holiday's song 'forest' and I have to say
        that it sounded like a dream. The music was so captivating that I felt like
        I was in a different world, one that was full of wonder and magic. I didn't
        need to stream anything else because this song was enough to transport me
        to a place of beauty and tranquility. As I listened, I felt my worries fade
        away, and I was left with a sense of peace and contentment.
    - summary: I valued the importance of friendship in music
      content: I believe that music is about friendship, and if you're lucky enough
        to play music with your friends, then you're truly winning. Being in a band
        can be tough, especially during the composition process, as people have different
        opinions and pull in different directions. However, when you're playing with
        friends, it makes all the challenges worth it. The bond that forms between
        band members is like no other, and it's what makes the music truly special.
        I feel grateful to have had the experience of playing music with friends,
        and I know that it's something that I'll always treasure.
    - summary: I appreciated a radio host who supported new artists
      content: I want to extend my big thanks to Paul Golder of Phoenix FM, who has
        been a constant supporter of new artists. In a time when radio stations rarely
        seek out and introduce new talent, Paul has been a beacon of hope. He's always
        willing to give new songs a listen, and in our case, he even gave our song
        a chance. I'm grateful for his dedication to promoting new music and for being
        a champion of emerging artists. It's people like Paul who make a real difference
        in the music industry, and I feel lucky to have had the chance to work with
        him.
    - summary: I received a funny gift for our frontman
      content: I want to thank Rob for the incredibly funny stonecoldseandyche gift
        he got for our frontman, who's currently out sick. The gift was a great way
        to cheer him up, and I'm sure it brought a smile to his face. It's always
        tough when someone's not feeling well, but a little bit of humor can go a
        long way in lifting their spirits. I'm grateful to Rob for his thoughtfulness
        and for being a part of our team's supportive network. The gift was also a
        nice distraction from the stress of the game, especially since we were playing
        against brentford and really needed the three points.

    - summary: I am proud of my dad for being a trailblazer
      content: I still get emotional when I think about my dad, Rocky Soulman Johnson,
        who became the first black tag team champion with Tony Atlas. I will forever
        be proud of who and what I am, and I love him for being a trailblazer and
        paving the way for me. His legacy is a constant reminder of the importance
        of perseverance and determination, and I strive to make him proud in everything
        I do.
    - summary: My brother won a UFC fight with my help
      content: I sent my brother, the UFC Middleweight Champion, and his team some
        of my world-famous Rock Toast as a pre-fight meal, which I believe gave him
        the energy and carbs he needed to win. Although I jokingly said that listening
        to my ring music while eating the toast was the reason for his win, I'm just
        happy to have been able to support him in some way. It was a hell of a card
        and a great night of fights, and I'm proud of my brother for his victory.
    - summary: I achieved my dream of having a career in the NFL
      content: Although I didn't become a player in the NFL, my dream of having a
        career in the NFL came true in a different way. I was grateful for the love
        and trust of the NFL, players, coaches, and fans, and I felt their insane
        positive energy. It was an amazing experience, and I'm thankful for the opportunity
        to be a part of the NFL community.
    - summary: I have strong roots in Tampa
      content: I have a special connection to Tampa, where I used to live off Dale
        Mabry as a little boy and later in Town & Country in my late teens and early
        20s. Those were defining years in my life, and I often think back to my '7
        bucks days' with nostalgia. Tampa will always be a significant part of my
        history and identity.
    - summary: I had a memorable encounter with Warren
      content: I recall a time when I was in a D-Line meeting, and Warren, who was
        on offense, showed up and said he was there to take my job. I responded by
        saying he wasn't taking my job, but it was all in good fun. We had a great
        dynamic, and I enjoyed our competitive banter. Those were valuable learning
        experiences that taught me a lot about perseverance and hard work.
    - summary: I'm excited about the XFL collaboration with the NFL
      content: As an XFL owner, I'm thrilled about our collaboration with the NFL
        to innovate and grow the game of football. My top priority will always be
        the players, and I believe this partnership will create new opportunities
        for them to succeed. It's an exciting time for football, and I'm eager to
        see the positive impact this collaboration will have on the sport.
    - summary: I'm searching for an old interview
      content: I'm trying to find an old interview I did in Calgary at the Stamps
        stadium back in 1995. I've asked Ian to help me get my hands on it, and I'm
        willing to reward him with a couple of cases of Teremana if he can find it.
        It's an important piece of my history, and I'd love to revisit that moment
        in my career.
    - summary: My tattoo has significant meaning
      content: The Warrior's Face in battle is not only our symbol but also a part
        of my tattoo, which symbolically tells a detailed story of my life. It represents
        strength, protection, pride, love, and mana, and it's a constant reminder
        of my values and heritage. I'm proud to wear it over my heart, and it serves
        as a reminder of where I come from and what I stand for.
    - summary: I had a great workout in Hawaii
      content: I had an intense workout in Hawaii, which was a great way to kick off
        the week. The 85-degree weather, lack of AC, and absence of mirrors made it
        a unique and challenging experience. I'm grateful for the grind and the opportunity
        to push myself to new limits. It's days like these that remind me of the importance
        of hard work and dedication.
    - summary: I'm proud of the success of Young Rock
      content: I'm thrilled with the positive reactions to our NBC show, Young Rock.
        It's a wild and true story of my life growing up, and I'm grateful to our
        writers, actors, and crew for their hard work and dedication. The show is
        a love letter to the crazy culture of pro wrestling that changed my life,
        and I'm proud to share it with the world.
    - summary: I surprised fans at a theater
      content: I dressed up as my character, Krypto, and surprised two audiences at
        a theater. It was a special moment, and I loved seeing the joy and shock on
        their faces. We also found a loving home for my dog, Quail, which made the
        experience even more meaningful. It's moments like these that remind me of
        the importance of giving back and making a positive impact on people's lives.
    - summary: I'm grateful for my tattoo artist
      content: I'm thankful for my tattoo artist, who created an opportunity for artists
        around the world to connect and grow together through his seminar and master
        class. Our company, ZOAEnergy, was proud to sponsor and support this incredible
        event, and I'm looking forward to future collaborations with my tattoo artist.
    - summary: I'm excited about the Black Adam movie
      content: I'm thrilled about the upcoming Black Adam movie, which is a character
        that speaks to my DNA. I've had the privilege of playing some great characters
        throughout my career, but this antihero is one of the most meaningful to me.
        I'm eager to see the film's impact and how it will be received by audiences
        around the world.

      content: I come from a long line of wrestlers, and my grandfather, High Chief
        Peter Maivia, was a brilliant trailblazer who paved the way for me. I'm proud
        to be a part of this legacy and to have had the opportunity to follow in his
        footsteps. The wrestling world will always be a significant part of my identity
        and heritage.

        and support throughout my career. My parents met under unusual circumstances,
        and their story is one that I'll always treasure. I'm proud to be a part of

        to be a part of it.

        it's a film that will resonate with audiences around the world. The character

        me every step of the way throughout my career. Their energy and enthusiasm
        are what drive me to keep pushing myself to new heights, and I'm grateful

    - summary: Medical equipment left in the rain for an elderly lady
      content: I was appalled when I saw that medical equipment had been left in the
        rain right outside an out-swinging door for an elderly lady. What made it
        even more unacceptable was that the front door was open to welcome the person
        delivering the equipment, and they didn't even bother to knock or ring the
        doorbell. I couldn't help but think about how this could have been handled
        better, especially considering the vulnerable person it was intended for.
        It was a moment that left me feeling frustrated and concerned for the well-being
        of the elderly lady.
    - summary: Inspiration from Katie
      content: As I was setting up my studio for a quick video, I couldn't help but
        think of Katie. I looked around at the chaos of Christmas presents, golf clubs,
        a broken Christmas tree, and evidence of my puppy's presence, and I smiled.
        Katie has always been an inspiration to me, and in that moment, I felt grateful
        for the positive influence she has had on my life. I thought about how she
        would approach a situation like this, and it gave me the motivation to tackle
        my task with a newfound sense of energy and creativity.
    - summary: Flight cancellation by Southwest Air
      content: I was looking forward to enjoying my Saturday night in Manhattan, but
        my plans were ruined when Southwest Air canceled my flight without giving
        me enough notice. I was left stranded in the airport with no upgrades available,
        and to make matters worse, I wouldn't be able to get a flight home for 48
        hours. I felt frustrated and disappointed by the lack of consideration shown
        by the airline, and I couldn't help but wonder why they couldn't have handled
        the situation better.
    - summary: Treasuring in-person moments
      content: As I reflected on my experiences, I realized how much I had missed
        networking and connecting with people in person. I had the opportunity to
        meet some amazing individuals, including Jeff Turner, and it reminded me of
        the importance of these face-to-face interactions. I felt grateful for the
        chance to treasure these moments and connect with like-minded people, and
        I encouraged others to do the same. In a world where virtual connections are
        becoming more common, I believe it's essential to prioritize in-person relationships
        and make the most of these opportunities.
    - summary: Walking with children at Walt Disney World
      content: It was 2 am, and I was at Walt Disney World with my three children.
        We had just been dropped off by the bus, but to our surprise, the driver refused
        to take us to the Dolphin hotel, citing a conference as the reason. I couldn't
        believe it - it was 2 am, and we were left with no choice but to walk another
        mile or so to our destination. I was exhausted, and my children were tired
        and cranky, but we had to persevere and make our way to the hotel. It was
        a challenging moment, but we eventually made it, and I was relieved to finally
        get some rest.
    - summary: Customer service rep sleeping on the job
      content: I was shocked when I came across a video of a customer service representative
        answering the phone while snoring. It was a 7-minute video, and I couldn't
        believe that someone could sleep so soundly with the TV blaring in the background.
        I thought about how this must be a contributing factor to the poor service
        that people often experience when dealing with insurance companies. It was
        a surreal moment, and I couldn't help but wonder how this could happen in
        a professional setting.

    - summary: I argue with someone about game development and company performance
      content: I was playing a game and someone was criticizing the game's developer,
        343, saying they were a mess because of layoffs. I responded by saying that
        many companies, including Rockstar, are going through layoffs and that doesn't
        mean they're a mess. I think the person was just spitting out random opinions
        without any source or facts to back them up. I told them to stop being dramatic
        and that their argument was baseless. I also pointed out that the game is
        still fun to play and that's what matters, not the company's internal issues.
    - summary: I discuss the concept of reward systems in games
      content: I was talking to someone about games and they were complaining about
        the lack of a reward system. I told them that I play games for fun and enjoyment,
        and that's what matters, not the rewards. I think people these days are too
        focused on getting something in return for playing games, rather than just
        enjoying the experience. I mentioned that back in the day, we played games
        like SNES, Sega, and GameCube without expecting any rewards, and we still
        had a great time.
    - summary: I share my thoughts on different types of games
      content: I was discussing games with someone and they were saying that Xbox
        only has certain types of games. I told them that games come in many different
        forms, not just story-driven narratives, which are mostly found on PS exclusive
        games. I prefer a variety of games, and I think Xbox has a good selection.
        I also mentioned that having only story-driven games is not my preferred choice,
        and that's okay.
    - summary: I explain the concept of contract negotiations and channel availability
      content: I was talking to someone about contract negotiations between companies
        and cable providers. I explained that if a company doesn't resign with the
        cable company, they can lose that channel or many channels, and all customers
        will be affected when the contract ends. I used Microsoft as an example and
        said that I'm sure they understand the potential ramifications of contract
        negotiations.
    - summary: I argue about the success of a game based on player numbers
      content: I was discussing a game with someone and they were saying that the
        player numbers were low. I disagreed, saying that 5,000 players on Steam and
        however many on Xbox seems like a good number to me. I compared it to PS games
        on Steam, which have similar player numbers. I think the person was trying
        to make it seem like 5,000 players is a bad thing, but I don't think that's
        the case.
    - summary: I defend a game's player base and its availability on different platforms
      content: I was talking to someone about a game and they were saying that it's
        not doing well because it only has 5,000 players on Steam. I told them that
        they're not getting the full picture, because the game is also available on
        Xbox and GamePass for PC and Xbox. I think the game is in a better place now
        than it was at launch, and I'm happy to see it doing well.
    - summary: I discuss the delay of a game and console wars
      content: I was talking to someone about a game that was delayed, and they were
        saying that Sony never delays games. I told them that's not true, and that
        a simple Google search would show that Sony has delayed games in the past.
        I think the console wars are getting out of hand, and people are too focused
        on comparing companies rather than just enjoying the games.
    - summary: I argue with someone about the length of time a game is delayed
      content: I was discussing a game with someone and they were saying that it was
        delayed for a long time. I told them that they were moving the goalpost and
        trying to stick to their narrative. I asked them when the game Wolverine is
        coming out, and I think they were trying to find a win in the argument, which
        I think is silly. I think we should just focus on the facts rather than trying
        to one-up each other.

    - summary: The author recalls a memorable sports moment
      content: I remember like yesterday when I was living in Buffalo and the Eagles
        played the Bills. Season started poorly then Birds won 5 in a row coming in
        vs. Bills who were great team. From where we were it looked like Randall was
        swallowed by Bruce Smith in end zone but emerged and bombed away. Alas, they
        lost. It was one of my first clear sports memories and it has stuck with me
        to this day.
    - summary: The author is frustrated with the Phillies management
      content: I’ve been saying for weeks that the Phillies staff is failing to get
        the most from the roster and we have a large enough sample size to say the
        Phillies are underachieving. The current staff's philosophies have not resonated
        with this roster. It’s time to make the difficult decision. They are still
        a couple of pieces away from serious contention and those pieces include the
        staff. I hope they prove me wrong, I truly do.
    - summary: The author thinks the Cowboys will not win with Jerry Jones
      content: Every Dallas Cowboys fan believes Jerry Jones is interested in fielding
        a contending team. But I think he does just enough to keep the brand in conversation
        to pocket marketing and stadium money while the fan base keeps drinking the
        Kool Aid saying “this is the year”. WAKE UP!! You’ll never win with Jones.
        He cares more about brand value than fielding a championship team.
    - summary: The author is disappointed with the Eagles performance
      content: I was really disappointed when the Eagles lost to the Lions. My Pittie
        ruferre, Gator, threw a flag, his bowl, his bone and our sofa after Lions
        face mask on Eagles Sanders. The NFL has a problem on their hands when they
        tout safety as priority and that blatant a potentially harmful foul is ignored.
        Fans are fed up with ineptitude.
    - summary: The author thinks the Phillies need a change in management
      content: I doubt Middleton will fire McPhail after talking him out of retirement
        nor Klentak after anointing him next Epstein even though they are deserving.
        Gabe is going and he is also deserving. He has shown no ability to sustain
        success. Change is needed and will be a high profile name. The Phillies need
        a new manager who can lead the team to victory.
    - summary: The author recalls a vivid memory of a sports series
      content: My most vivid memory of that series was game 4. Runs were being scored
        in bunches. Phils were up 14-9 in the 8th, feet up, Wild Thing on the mound.
        No worries. Then boom. 15-14. Precursor to Game 6. Ugh. Although Phils did
        respond with 2-0 whitewashing in Game 5 so there was hope. It was a thrilling
        series that I will never forget.
    - summary: The author is frustrated with the Cowboys coaching staff
      content: Kellen Moore witnessed Dalvin Cook serve Elliott his RB lunch all game
        and wanted to find a way for Zeke to be hero and it backfired. The Cowboys
        need to be hitting on all cylinders including the staff to make playoff push
        and that isn’t going to happen. Last night showed many weak links. The coaching
        staff needs to step up their game if they want to win.
    - summary: The author thinks Carson Wentz is a clutch performer
      content: I think it is safe to say that all the praisers, the biggest being
        Skip Bayless, can now say Jeff > Jerry, Doug > Jason, and most definitely,
        Carson > Dak. Wentz proved once and for all who the true clutch performer
        is between 11 and 4. Go Eagles. He has shown time and time again that he can
        lead his team to victory in critical situations.
    - summary: The author is impressed with Florida's handling of the virus
      content: Florida is doing a great job reengaging. Our leaders, medical community
        and citizenry have been a great example for the nation to follow. You will
        never get full compliance but with the 3rd highest population and most people
        over 65 the virus' impact has been nowhere near forecasted biblical numbers.
        It's a testament to the state's ability to come together and respond to a
        crisis.
    - summary: The author is frustrated with the NFL's handling of player safety
      content: The NFL has a problem on their hands when they tout safety as priority
        and that blatant a potentially harmful foul is ignored. Fans are fed up with
        ineptitude. It's not just about winning or losing, it's about protecting the
        players and ensuring their safety. The NFL needs to do better.

    - summary: The author criticizes modern society and politics
      content: I often find myself frustrated with the state of our society and politics.
        It seems like anyone who wants to be a politician should not be allowed to
        be one, and instead, they should be picked from the best society has to offer.
        I think about how some people in power, like Belgium's Minister of Health,
        might be more concerned with their own interests than the well-being of the
        people. This feeling of disillusionment is exacerbated by the fact that it
        seems like those in power are often more focused on their own gain, like going
        to all-you-can-eat buffets, rather than serving the people.
    - summary: The author discusses conspiracy theories and societal issues
      content: I've been thinking a lot about the data from Deagel and how it seems
        to make sense when you look at the current state of the American landscape,
        with its financial bubbles and social issues. It's like the dreams of any
        conspiracy theorist come true. I wonder if there's any truth to these theories
        and how they might be connected to the problems we're facing as a society.
        It's unsettling to think that there might be more to these theories than just
        speculation.
    - summary: The author reflects on social dynamics and acceptance
      content: I've noticed that in my circle of male friends, nobody has ever been
        upset or angry with someone for being gay. However, when someone is being
        bitchy or displays unpleasant behavior, nobody wants them around. It's interesting
        to me that this kind of behavior is often more off-putting than someone's
        sexual orientation. I think this says a lot about what we value in our social
        relationships and how we treat others.
    - summary: The author critiques modern feminism and societal expectations
      content: I think it's unfortunate that modern feminism has convinced younger
        women that they should strive to be equal to men, but in a way that feels
        like they're being relegated to being mere economic units. It's like the state
        is indoctrinating them to prioritize work over other aspects of their lives,
        like family and relationships. I worry that this is having a negative impact
        on women and society as a whole.
    - summary: The author makes a humorous observation about a public figure
      content: I was watching TV and saw Brett Baier, and I couldn't help but think
        that he looks like a living caricature from an old Dick Tracy comic. He's
        got that classic Boston Irish cop look, and I could totally see him in a pinstriped
        suit and fedora, like a character from a movie. It's amusing to me how some
        public figures can have such distinctive and memorable appearances.
    - summary: The author questions the official story behind a mysterious event
      content: I heard about a 24-year-old who suddenly died, and it seemed suspicious
        to me. The official story didn't add up, and I couldn't help but think that
        there might be more to it than what we're being told. It's frustrating when
        events like this happen, and we're left with more questions than answers.
        I wonder if we'll ever get to the bottom of what really happened.

    - summary: I think Apple's introduction of something new may not be necessary
      content: I was thinking about Apple's potential introduction of something new
        and I realized that it may not be necessary. If not, CD is fine, even for
        small amounts of data. The main thing is the learning curve. If you already
        know it, no problem. If not, maybe just Codable JSON is best for small stuff.
        I've been considering the possibilities and I think it's all about the difference
        between law enforcement and surveillance, which is what Apple is going to
        do.
    - summary: I didn't enjoy a story due to its forced plot and two-dimensional characters
      content: I recently read a story and I have to say that I didn't enjoy it. The
        story feels quite forced, and the characters are two-dimensional. I really
        think it is cultural. For the US market, these British types probably seem
        quirky. I wonder how popular it is in the UK. I was expecting something more
        engaging, but the dramatic aspects didn't resonate with me.
    - summary: I understand the difference between law enforcement and surveillance
      content: I've been following a thread and I have to say that I understand the
        difference between law enforcement and surveillance. It's all about the difference
        between law enforcement, where you need a warrant to examine something, and
        surveillance, which is what Apple is going to do. It's that which makes people
        angry, and some people scared. I think it's essential to recognize this distinction.
    - summary: I think SEO is a game played by those with deep pockets
      content: I've been thinking about SEO and I believe that it's a game played
        by those with deep pockets. If you are thinking a lot about SEO, you are already
        playing the VCs game. It's tough to do without deep pockets. We rarely do
        ads. Very occasionally a podcast or specialized web site. No Google, FB etc.
        I think it's challenging for smaller players to compete.
    - summary: I remember a blog post by Cabel about Panic pulling out of the Mac
        App Store
      content: I remember a blog post by Cabel when Panic pulled out of the Mac App
        Store. It was about a year after, and things were going very well. But don't
        think that will happen for every app. If you are established, it doesn't matter
        to be in the Mac App Store. Same true of Sketch. I think it's interesting
        to consider the implications of this decision.
    - summary: I think the hardware of a Tesla is not that complicated
      content: I've been thinking about Tesla and I believe that the hardware of a
        Tesla is not that complicated. There are lots of people and factories in the
        world that can make you a car once you design it. The interesting part is
        a 'car as accessory', and guess which company is best at that? I think it's
        a fascinating perspective on the automotive industry.
    - summary: I think the most powerful programming language is Assembler
      content: I've been thinking about programming languages and I believe that the
        most powerful programming language is Assembler. Because you can program anything
        the chip can do. But we don't use it. Instead, we work with languages that
        give less control over fine details. Same tradeoff. I think it's a balance
        in software development.
    - summary: I think the sync/async divide is a legacy issue
      content: I've been thinking about the sync/async divide and I believe that it's
        a legacy issue. Sync shouldn't really exist, because in theory any function
        could take an arbitrary amount of time. But we heuristically say 'I know this
        will be less than 50ms on current hardware, so nobody will notice it'. I think
        it's an interesting perspective on software development.
    - summary: I think a gatekeeper system could work well for policing
      content: I've been thinking about policing and I believe that a gatekeeper system
        could work well. Works great on macOS. Yes, they need to monitor security,
        like they do on macOS now, but it is much less effort than app review. I think
        an independent panel may be best for policing. No bias. I think it's a solution
        worth considering.
    - summary: I think it's challenging for a Mac-only app to grow quickly
      content: I've been thinking about the challenges of growing a Mac-only app and
        I believe that it's tough to do. When I was at a company 7-8 years ago, it
        was a very profitable, but lean company. They decided to grow fast, but I'm
        not sure how realistic that was for a Mac-only app. Has there ever been an
        indie Mac app with 200-odd full-time employees before Sketch? I think it's
        a difficult question to answer.

    - summary: I was blocked by a Chinese news channel for posting a picture of Winnie
        Pooh and Xi Jinping
      content: I still remember the day I posted a picture of Winnie Pooh and Xi Jinping
        in the comment section of a Chinese foreign language news channel with 13
        million followers. I was shocked when I found out that I had been blocked
        by the channel. It was a strange feeling, knowing that my simple action had
        been deemed unacceptable by the channel's moderators. This experience made
        me realize the limitations of freedom of speech in China and how easily one
        can be censored for expressing their opinions or sharing seemingly harmless
        content. I couldn't help but wonder what other forms of censorship existed
        in the country and how they affected the daily lives of its citizens.
    - summary: I believe having children is not selfish but a way to create a better
        world
      content: As I reflect on my thoughts about having children, I am convinced that
        it is not a selfish decision, but rather a way to create a better world. I
        think about the joy and love that children bring to our lives, and how they
        have the potential to make a positive impact on society. When I imagine myself
        as a parent, I envision a future where my children will grow up to be kind,
        compassionate, and responsible individuals who will contribute to making the
        world a better place. I believe that having children is a way to leave a lasting
        legacy and to create a sense of purpose and meaning in our lives. I am not
        alone in this thinking, as many people share my view that having children
        is a way to bring happiness and fulfillment to our lives.
    - summary: I think media bias is a significant issue in today's world
      content: I have always been interested in understanding the world around me,
        and I believe that media plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions.
        However, I have come to realize that media bias is a significant issue in
        today's world. I remember doing a research project in college where I compared
        the biases of CNN and Fox News, and I was struck by the differences in their
        reporting styles and the ways in which they presented information. This experience
        made me more aware of the importance of critically evaluating the information
        we consume and seeking out diverse perspectives. I think it's essential to
        recognize that media bias can have a profound impact on our understanding
        of the world and to make an effort to seek out balanced and unbiased information.
    - summary: I was surprised by the reaction to my post about the LGBTQ movement
      content: I still remember the day I posted about the LGBTQ movement and the
        reaction I received. I was surprised by the strong opinions and emotions that
        my post elicited, and I realized that this was a highly charged and sensitive
        topic. As I reflected on the comments and responses I received, I began to
        understand the complexities and nuances of the issue. I thought about the
        importance of respecting and understanding different perspectives, even if
        we disagree with them. This experience taught me the value of empathy and
        the need to approach sensitive topics with care and sensitivity. I learned
        that even seemingly simple statements can have a significant impact on others
        and that it's essential to consider the potential consequences of our words
        and actions.
    - summary: I believe that people should be aware of the influence of NGOs and
        their funding
      content: I have always been interested in understanding the ways in which NGOs
        and other organizations shape our world. As I delved deeper into the topic,
        I became aware of the significant influence that NGOs can have on our lives
        and the importance of understanding their funding sources. I think it's essential
        for people to be aware of the potential biases and agendas of NGOs and to
        critically evaluate the information they provide. This awareness can help
        us make more informed decisions and to better understand the complex issues
        that affect our world. I believe that transparency and accountability are
        crucial in this regard, and I hope that more people will become aware of the
        importance of NGO funding and its potential impact on our lives.

    - summary: I am considering asking a girl to be my girlfriend and wondering if
        there is any other reason to date as teenagers
      content: I have been thinking about asking a girl I know pretty well to be my
        girlfriend, but I am not sure if it's the right thing to do. As Christians,
        we won't be doing anything inappropriate or sexual, so I'm wondering if there's
        any other reason to date in the first place. Is it just about having a title,
        or is there something more to it? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
    - summary: I had a long day at work and am feeling tired and frustrated
      content: I just got back from a long day of work at Wendy's and I'm feeling
        exhausted. I had to make a lot of hard decisions and clean a lot of bathrooms,
        which was really tough. I'm just feeling mentally and physically drained.
        I'm looking forward to going home and relaxing.
    - summary: I started dating a girl named Brittany and we had a great time together
      content: I recently started dating a girl named Brittany and we've been having
        a great time together. We share the same Christian values and it's been really
        nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with. We've been going out
        on dates and just enjoying each other's company.
    - summary: I got into an argument with my girlfriend's friend and am wondering
        if I should apologize
      content: I got into an argument with my girlfriend's friend and I'm not sure
        if I should apologize. I think I was in the right, but her friend is still
        upset with me. My girlfriend thinks I shouldn't apologize, but I'm not sure
        what to do. I don't want to cause any more tension, but I also don't want
        to apologize for something I don't think I did wrong.
    - summary: My girlfriend surprised me with a romantic dinner and gifts for my
        birthday
      content: My girlfriend surprised me with a romantic dinner and gifts for my
        birthday. It was such a sweet and thoughtful gesture. We had a great time
        together and I felt really special. She even cooked my favorite food and got
        me some really nice presents.
    - summary: I found a bomb threat at school and had to turn it in to the principal
      content: I was walking down the hall at school when I saw a piece of paper on
        the ground that said 'There is a bomb in the school. It will go off at 11:30.'
        I was really scared, but I knew I had to do something. I turned it in to the
        principal and he evacuated the school. It ended up being a prank, but I'm
        just glad I did the right thing.
    - summary: I had a great time performing with the All-County Chorus
      content: I recently performed with the All-County Chorus and it was an amazing
        experience. I was really nervous at first, but once we started singing, I
        felt so alive. It was great to be able to share my love of music with others
        and to be a part of something so special.
    - summary: I received a thoughtful gift from my girlfriend for our three-month
        anniversary
      content: My girlfriend gave me a really thoughtful gift for our three-month
        anniversary. She got me a sterling silver ring with a Christian fish on it,
        as well as a Veggie Tales plaque to hang on my wall. It was such a sweet gesture
        and I felt really loved and appreciated.
    - summary: I am doing an article for Journalism class about gay marriages and
        am seeking opinions
      content: I'm doing an article for my Journalism class about gay marriages and
        I'm seeking opinions from people on the topic. I've already interviewed a
        few people, including a gay student at my school, and I'm interested in hearing
        more perspectives. I think it's an important issue and I want to make sure
        I represent all sides fairly.
    - summary: I got my learner's permit and am excited to start driving
      content: I just got my learner's permit and I'm so excited to start driving.
        I've been waiting for this moment for a long time and I feel like it's a big
        step towards independence. I'm looking forward to practicing and eventually
        getting my license.
    - summary: I had a fun time shopping with my girlfriend and got her some surprise
        gifts
      content: I had a great time shopping with my girlfriend at the mall. I was able
        to sneak away and get her a few surprise gifts, which she loved. It was fun
        to see the look on her face when she opened them and I felt happy to be able
        to make her happy.
    - summary: I had a great Christmas and received some wonderful gifts
      content: I had a great Christmas this year and received some wonderful gifts.
        My favorite gift was a DVD/VCR combo, but I also got some other really cool
        things like a leather jacket and some Swiss Colony Chocolates. It was a really
        fun day and I felt grateful for all the people in my life.
    - summary: I am looking forward to graduating and getting my own car
      content: I'm really looking forward to graduating and getting my own car. My
        grandmother has offered to give me her old car, but I'm hoping to get a new
        one eventually. I've been thinking about what kind of car I want and I'm excited
        to have the freedom to drive wherever I want.
    - summary: I had a great Valentine's Day with my girlfriend and enjoyed a nice
        dinner and movie
      content: I had a great Valentine's Day with my girlfriend. We went to see the
        movie '50 First Dates' and then had a nice dinner at Olive Garden. It was
        a really fun night and I felt happy to be able to spend it with her. We also
        exchanged gifts and I got her some nice things like roses and a teddy bear.
    - summary: I am dealing with a difficult situation with a troll on my blog comments
      content: I'm having a tough time dealing with a troll on my blog comments. Someone
        has been leaving nasty and disgusting comments, and it's been really frustrating.
        I've tried to ignore them, but it's hard not to take it personally. I'm just
        trying to stay calm and focus on the positive comments from my friends and
        readers.

    - summary: Starting a blog with a friend
      content: I decided to start this blog without much consulting with my friend
        Adam, who I always talk about doing things with but never end up doing. I
        thought it would be a good idea to just start it and see what happens, even
        though Adam might not like the design and might lose interest once he sees
        it's actually up and running. I'm a bit convinced by his potential arguments
        that having a blog is unoriginal and lame, but I think it's still worth trying.
        I'm going to send this to Adam and ask him to start contributing, so we can
        write down our thoughts and ideas before we realize they're not that cool
        or original.
    - summary: Reacting to an article about young women stopping work
      content: I read an article by Christine Stansell about why young women often
        stop working, and I found her argument to be confusing and possibly irresponsible.
        She suggests that women stop working because they're afraid of losing their
        romantic prospects or because they put their own needs second, but I think
        these are contradictory ideas. I know some ambitious women who have stopped
        working in their late 20s or early 30s, and it's not because they're putting
        their needs second, but because they just don't like their jobs. I think Stansell's
        argument is outdated and doesn't apply to this generation of women. I also
        think it's annoying when well-educated women who stop working in their 20s
        or 30s think of themselves as martyrs, when really they're just making a choice.
    - summary: Disliking Dave Eggers' writing and social activism
      content: I never really liked Dave Eggers as a writer, but I used to think he
        was cool and a motivating force in contemporary fiction. However, after he
        started a tutorial program for poor kids and published an editorial in the
        NY Times about Teach-for-America, I think he's become too self-righteous and
        sanctimonious. His writing has also become boring and pseudo-political. I
        think he's like the Bono of postmodern literature, and I find him annoying.
    - summary: Finding NY Times articles about sex to be creepy
      content: I think there's something creepy about the way the NY Times writes
        about sex, especially when it comes to kids and sex. I read an article about
        teenagers and casual sex, and it seemed like thinly veiled child porn. The
        article was written for an older audience, and it seemed like the author was
        trying to shock or titillate them. I'm not sure why the NY Times feels the
        need to write about this topic in this way, and I think it's uncomfortable
        to read.
    - summary: Experiencing a scare in DC
      content: There was a scare in DC when a plane veered into restricted airspace
        while Ronald Reagan's body was being transported across the district. The
        Capitol Building and Supreme Court were evacuated, and Wolf Blitzer looked
        concerned on CNN. I was scared, but it turned out to be a false alarm. I wonder
        if Adam was scared too.
    - summary: Having mixed feelings about Oprah's book club
      content: I have a knee-jerk reaction of condescension towards Oprah's book club,
        but at the same time, I think it's done a lot of good for the publishing industry
        and has gotten people to read books they might not have otherwise. I think
        it's annoying when people sneer at Oprah's book club, but I also think that
        reading great literature is a personal and solitary experience, and that it's
        not something that should be led by someone like Oprah. I'm conflicted about
        whether Oprah's book club is a good thing or not.
    - summary: Criticizing David Brooks' writing and intentions
      content: I think David Brooks is a good writer, but I'm glad there's a backlash
        against his work lately. I think he deserves it, because he's been carrying
        a biased and xenophobic point of view into supposedly liberal publications.
        He uses stereotypes and caricatures to make his points, and I think it's unacceptable.
        I think he's attacking liberal values and the people who hold them, and that
        his writing is not just annoying, but also dangerous.
    - summary: Reflecting on the 60s and participatory journalism
      content: I've been thinking about the 60s and the kind of participatory journalism
        that was popular back then. I read an article by Robert Stone about Ken Kesey,
        and it was nostalgic for the 60s. I think that kind of journalism is not as
        good as it used to be, and that modern attempts at it are often hollow and
        lacking in substance. I think journalists should be wary of satisfying their
        own curiosity and should strive to do more than just tell entertaining stories.
    - summary: Reacting to an article about the difficulties of being a writer
      content: I read an article by an anonymous author about the difficulties of
        being a writer, and I thought it was self-indulgent and stupid. I think the
        author is making assumptions about how easy it is to make a living as a writer,
        and that they're not considering the sacrifices that come with it. I think
        Kafka's description of the sacrifices of writing is more accurate, and that
        the anonymous author is just whining.
    - summary: Struggling to put in contact lenses
      content: I've been trying to figure out how to put in contact lenses, and it's
        been extremely difficult. I think it's one of those things that nobody talks
        about being hard, but it's actually really challenging. I've been feeling
        stupid and incompetent because I couldn't do it right away, but I'm trying
        to be patient and persistent. I think there are a lot of things in life that
        are like this, where nobody acknowledges how hard they are, and it's damaging
        to our self-confidence.
    - summary: Thinking about targeted advertising
      content: I've been thinking about targeted advertising, and I'm not sure if
        it's a problem or not. I think it's the natural evolution of advertising,
        and that it's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm used to giving out my personal
        data online, and I don't really think about my privacy. I think targeted advertising
        can be more effective and less annoying than random ads, and that it's just
        the way things are going in the 21st century.
    - summary: Reacting to the Real World finale
      content: I watched the Real World finale, and it was a disappointment. I didn't
        cry or laugh, and I don't think I'll miss the cast members that much. I think
        the show has become too formulaic and predictable, and that the cast members
        are just going through the motions. I'm not surprised that the producers didn't
        show the alleged rape that happened in the house, because it's not the kind
        of thing they usually address on the show.
    - summary: Thinking about the decline of literary reading
      content: I read a report about the decline of literary reading, and I was surprised
        to find that the number of people doing creative writing has actually increased.
        However, the number of people taking creative writing classes has decreased,
        which I think is a paradox. I wonder if blogs count as creative writing, and
        I think it's interesting that Americans are more interested in writing than
        reading literature.

    - summary: I am excited to hit the ice again after maintenance
      content: I have been waiting for the ice surface at Penn State's Ice arena to
        reopen after its yearly maintenance. It has been closed since the middle of
        May, and I have been trying to contain my need to go into 'hockey withdraw.'
        I am excited to get back on the ice and get some exercise. The ice rink is
        set to reopen on June 15th, and I plan to be there as soon as possible.
    - summary: I had a satirical column published that was misinterpreted
      content: I wrote a column about Jarome Iginla for the Hockey Pundits, intending
        it to be satirical, but it was published with a less offensive edited version
        and ended up sounding borderline terrible. I was worried that I would get
        fired, but I guess I'll just have to 'fly right' from now on. I still think
        that Iginla's first name should be pronounced 'Yar-o-may' to match his exotic
        last name.
    - summary: I took my last skate on the ice before moving away
      content: I took my last skate on the ice at Penn State's hockey rink before
        moving away from State College, PA. The rink has been like a sanctum to me,
        a place where I can escape my troubles and just enjoy the sport I love. I
        skated as hard and fast as I could, and even gave it one last lap for good
        measure. I'm going to miss this place and the sense of freedom that comes
        with skating.
    - summary: I met a nice girl at the ice rink
      content: I met a nice girl named Chrissy at the ice rink while I was skating.
        She was watching the skaters from the bench and told me that she was a student
        studying psychology. We talked for a bit, and I was impressed by her interests.
        I might go back and talk to her some more someday. I also ran into some old
        friends and invited them to be guests on my radio show, Sportsline on WRSC/WBLF.
    - summary: I went to a Penguins game and relived old memories
      content: I went to a Penguins game at the Sports Cafe & Grille, and it brought
        back a lot of old memories. I used to go there all the time, dressed in my
        Penguins jerseys, surrounded by Flyers fans. One time, a Flyers fan shoved
        me in the back, but the bartenders threw him out. It was good to be one of
        the 'regulars' again, even if it was just for a night.
    - summary: I had a dream about playing hockey
      content: I had a dream that I was suiting up for the Penn State Icers and getting
        ready to take the ice. But just as I was about to start playing, someone told
        me that I wasn't really part of the team and that my services weren't needed.
        I was disappointed, but it was just a dream. I wish it had been a more pleasant
        one, but I guess that's just the way it goes sometimes.
    - summary: I consoled my family after my grandfather's passing
      content: My maternal grandfather, Stephen M, passed away, and I was consoling
        my family. We talked about his love of hockey and the Penguins, and I remembered
        all the good times we had watching games together. I decided to salute him
        by watching a Penguins game and cracking open an Iron City Beer. It was a
        small way to honor his memory, but it felt right.
    - summary: I played in a roller hockey game with fellow Penguins fans
      content: I played in a roller hockey game with some fellow Pittsburgh Penguins
        fans at Bladerunners in Harmarville, PA. It was a great time, and I had a
        lot of fun. I wish I had more friends who shared my interests, but it was
        good to be around people who loved hockey as much as I do. We even went to
        Primanti's for a bite to eat afterwards, which was a nice way to cap off the
        day.
    - summary: I met a former stripper who is a hockey fan
      content: I was talking to a former stripper from California via instant messenger,
        and she told me that she had gone to a hockey game the night before. She said
        she had a great time and loved hockey. It was cool to meet someone who shared
        my passion for the sport, even if we came from different backgrounds.
    - summary: I was troubled by a blog post from a fellow hockey fan
      content: I read a blog post from a fellow hockey fan, Tim Harvey, that really
        troubled me. He was fed up with the NHL and the petty disputes that have plagued
        the league for years. I understood where he was coming from, but I didn't
        think he should give up on the sport entirely. I think the game is bigger
        than the problems it's facing, and I encouraged him to keep loving hockey,
        even if it's just by watching a peewee game or skating around the rink.

    - summary: I get stressed during holidays
      content: I tend to get extra stressed around the holidays. Even if nothing has
        changed in my schedule, I suddenly feel like I have so much going on and it's
        kind of overwhelming. I don't know if it's the prospect of all the driving
        between and within cities that will take place or if it's thinking of the
        millions of family members I'll see or what. My threshold for stress just
        decreases. But I have faith that God will give me the strength to handle all
        the activity.
    - summary: I started a blog to stay in touch with people
      content: I accidentally ended up on blogger.com and decided to read a few posts.
        Then I thought it might be fun to have one of my own. And it's free... I'm
        using this blog to stay in touch with people I don't call or email as often
        as I should, so they can make sure I'm still alive. I can also tell people
        random things about my life.
    - summary: I had a close call with a burner on my stove
      content: I was cleaning the kitchen and noticed it was awfully warm near the
        stove. I checked and one of the burners was on. The stove hadn't been used
        today, so that means it had been on since last night! Good thing it was on
        medium-low, or it could have been a disaster.
    - summary: My garage door opener broke and trapped me
      content: I was trying to leave the house and I pushed the garage door opener
        button, walked to my car and opened it, and then the stupid garage door opener
        self-destructed! It got about 1/3 of the way open, stopped, started buzzing
        and vibrating violently, the plastic cover over the light bulb shot off of
        it, then something broke and the door came slamming back down! Now I cant
        get my car out of the garage.
    - summary: I had a great Thanksgiving with my family
      content: We were able to get the spring replaced on the possessed garage door
        so we can open and close it manually for now. Doug's working on fixing the
        opener. Thanksgiving was great! There was all the usual stuff - turkey, sweet
        potatoes, broccoli & rice casserole, etc. I'm pleased to announce that I single-handedly
        ate a chocolate pie over the course of three days!
    - summary: I'm struggling with allergies and sinus infections
      content: I've been suffering from the mother of all allergy attacks for the
        past couple of days. I think it's trying to turn into a sinus infection. I
        honestly think it might feel good to have someone step on my head right now.
        My cats have been keeping me company, but they can be a handful too - like
        when Charlie considers it his sacred duty to wake me up in the morning by
        leaping across a pillow and landing with all four feet and 16 lbs. on my abdomen!
    - summary: I'm feeling better after being sick
      content: I'm pleased to report that I do seem to be improving. I still have
        a head full of 'stuff' and a slightly rattly cough, but I feel a lot better!
        I've been resting and taking it easy, and I'm looking forward to getting back
        to my normal routine. I've also been reading a book called Finding Peace by
        Charles Stanley, which has been helpful.
    - summary: I had a funny encounter with my cat Cordelia
      content: Doug was holding Cordy and had her on her back like a baby. She was
        only tolerating it, really. One of her paws was sticking out toward me, so
        I started pretending to kiss it and made little kissy noises. She put her
        paw on my face and pushed me away! This only encouraged me, so I came back
        and started doing it again. This time she reached over with the other paw
        and smacked me in the face!
    - summary: A deer hit my car
      content: I was driving down the street and saw something out of the corner of
        my eye. It was a deer headed straight for the side of my car! By the time
        I even registered what I had seen, the poor thing had hit the back right side
        of the car. I'm trying to convince myself that it just stunned it and it's
        okay. I was even afraid to look at the car because I was afraid I'd see something
        that would convince me otherwise.
    - summary: My husband Doug is away on a business trip
      content: I'm feeling pretty distracted and sensitive this week. More preoccupation
        with Doug leaving the country on Saturday. I'm not really anxious about it
        anymore, but I'm not looking forward to it either. I like the guy - don't
        really want him to leave for two weeks, ya know? I've been trying to keep
        myself busy and I'm looking forward to seeing him again in 13 days.
    - summary: I'm struggling to adjust to Doug being away
      content: I'm feeling pretty down today. I miss Doug and it's not easy being
        alone in the house. I've been trying to keep myself busy, but it's just not
        the same without him. I did talk to him this morning and he's doing well,
        but I still can't wait until he gets back. I've been counting down the days
        until his return - only 12 days to go!
    - summary: I had a funny encounter with my cat Charlie
      content: I woke up sometime in the wee hours of morning and somehow realized
        that there was something against my front and my back. My pillow was against
        my back and I don't know how he managed it, but I was on my side and Charlie
        was all curled up against my front and I had my arm around him. Cute snuggle
        kitty! Of course, he counteracted the cuteness by clawing the carpet at 5:30
        this morning for no apparent reason!
    - summary: I'm trying to get back into my exercise routine
      content: I've only worked out twice in the two weeks that Doug was gone and
        this is the first time I've gone since he got back. I've decided to up my
        time on the elliptical trainer from 20 minutes to 40 minutes. Today I made
        it to 35 minutes before I stopped. I'm hoping to get back into my routine
        and start feeling more energized and focused.
    - summary: Doug is back home and we're enjoying each other's company
      content: Doug is home - yeah! I picked him up at the airport on Saturday and
        he was tired and still didn't have much of a voice, but was otherwise intact
        and happy to be home! We've been spending quality time together and enjoying
        each other's company. It's great to have him back and I'm looking forward
        to getting back into our normal routine.

    - summary: I am infuriated by Michael Moore's propaganda
      content: I recently watched a film by Michael Moore and I must say it infuriated
        me. Not because I disagree with his views, but because of the way he presents
        them. He takes bits and pieces of facts and uses them to spread his propaganda.
        I believe in the importance of opposing views and I think it's essential to
        challenge my own views in order to learn and grow. However, this challenge
        must be based on facts, and when the facts are unclear, we must agree that
        they are unclear. Michael Moore doesn't play by these rules, and that's what
        infuriates me. I encourage people not to give him money by watching his movie
        and instead, look for balanced criticism of his work. I believe everyone has
        the right to speak their mind, but I also believe in speaking out against
        misinformation.
    - summary: I am disappointed with the Bush Administration's handling of oil in
        Iraq
      content: During the run-up to the war in Iraq, I was told that one of the reasons
        for the invasion was to gain control of Iraq's oil. As someone who drives
        an SUV, I was pleased with this idea, hoping that it would lead to lower gas
        prices. However, now that the transfer of sovereignty is official, it seems
        that the Bush Administration has lost its chance to 'suck all of the oil out
        of Iraq.' I'm disappointed that gas prices didn't drop as I had hoped. Instead
        of taking the oil for free, the Coalition sold it on the market, and all the
        money from the sales went into the Iraqi Redevelopment Fund. I think it's
        ironic that we spent billions of dollars on the war and didn't get anything
        in return, except for another free and democratic society.
    - summary: I support the Supreme Court's ruling on detainees' right to a hearing
      content: I've never been happy with the policy of holding people indefinitely
        without the opportunity for a hearing. It goes against the American system
        of justice, which is based on the principle of due process. Everyone deserves
        due process, and the heart of due process is the right to a hearing. I understand
        that in times of war, we can't give immediate hearings to every person captured,
        but I believe the Department of Defense could set up a military tribunal for
        this purpose. I think Congress should act to define what these hearings should
        look like, but I'm afraid they won't do anything contrary to the White House
        in an election year. I'm glad the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the detainees'
        right to a hearing, and I believe it's a step in the right direction.
    - summary: I enjoy celebrating the Fourth of July with my family
      content: The Fourth of July is my second favorite holiday, right behind Christmas.
        I love celebrating it with my family at the lake, where we have a big gathering
        with good food, fun, and of course, fireworks. It's a time for patriotism
        and pyrotechnics, and I feel grateful to be able to celebrate it with the
        people I love. We always have a big display of fireworks, and it's something
        I look forward to every year. It's a time to relax, have fun, and enjoy each
        other's company, and I feel lucky to have such a wonderful family to share
        it with.
    - summary: I bought a new computer and am unsure what to do with my old one
      content: I recently ordered a new Dell computer, which I'm excited to start
        using. However, I'm not sure what to do with my old computer and printer.
        I've had them for a while, and I'm attached to them, but I know I need to
        get rid of them to make room for the new one. I'm considering selling them
        or giving them away, but I'm not sure what the best option is. I've heard
        that there are stores that buy used computers and printers, but I'm not sure
        if that's the best way to go. I'm also thinking about putting them up on eBay,
        but I'm not sure if I'll get a good price for them. I guess I'll just have
        to do some research and figure out what to do with them.
    - summary: I am unimpressed with John Kerry's presidential campaign
      content: I've been watching the Democratic convention, and I have to say that
        I'm unimpressed with John Kerry's campaign. I think he lacks charm and hasn't
        made any real policy statements. He's trying to position himself to the right
        of Bush on the war on terrorism, but I don't think that's going to work. I
        think he's the best choice for the 'Anybody-but-Bush' crowd, but that's not
        enough to win an election. I was more impressed with John Edwards' speech,
        and I think he has a lot of potential as a future candidate. I'm not sure
        what the future holds for Kerry, but I don't think he's the right person to
        be president.
    - summary: I am frustrated with the new Pepsi contract at my university
      content: I recently found out that my university has signed a contract with
        Pepsi, which means that Coke is no longer available on campus. I'm frustrated
        because I prefer Coke, and now I have to pay $1.25 for a bottle of Pepsi or
        Mountain Dew. I think it's outrageous that the price of a bottle of pop increased
        from $1 to $1.25 overnight. I'm also worried that the Bump, a popular hangout
        spot on campus, won't be able to sell Coke products anymore. I'm not sure
        what to do, but I'm considering boycotting Pepsi and looking for alternative
        options. I just wish the university had considered the students' preferences
        before signing the contract.

    - summary: I attended Easter sunrise service at Mount Pisgah
      content: I had to get up really early today to attend the Easter sunrise service
        at Mount Pisgah, which started at 4:30. I was exhausted, but it was worth
        it to see many people from our church and Lindsey and her crew. After the
        service, I went home and fell asleep on the couch, sleeping for a few hours.
        Later that day, my friends Greg, Torrie, Joe Paul, and Katie came over to
        hunt Easter eggs, and we had a great time. We even went to Francis BBQ, where
        my arranged prom date Mary works. I was a bit nervous about seeing her, but
        she was really funny and I think we'll have a good time at prom. I'm considering
        calling her to ask if she wants to do something before prom, but she works
        a lot, so I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
    - summary: I spent hours reading the 9/11 timeline
      content: I just spent almost two hours reading the 9/11 timeline, and it's really
        scary to think that so many people, including high-ranking government officials,
        could have had knowledge of the attacks before they happened. It's mind-boggling
        to think about how something like that could have occurred. I'm leaving for
        Louisville tomorrow and won't return until Thursday, so I need to get my homework
        done before I leave. I started working on it, but I got sidetracked, and now
        I have two chapters to read in my AP book and a ton of review problems for
        math to finish before I go.
    - summary: I'm feeling uncool about prom and my life
      content: I've come to the conclusion that I'm uncool because I don't have any
        after-prom plans, and my tux is all messed up. I'm also feeling a bit down
        about not having a life, and I haven't been posting on my blog lately. I did
        apply for FBLA Reporter, and I got VP of Competitive Events, which I'm happy
        about. I just hope nobody gets mad at me for getting the position. Prom is
        coming up, and I hope it rocks, but I'm also a bit nervous about it. I've
        heard that the restaurant we're going to, Showgun, throws food, so I'm not
        sure if it's the best place to eat before prom. I'm just hoping to make it
        through the day without any disasters.
    - summary: My dad quit his job and everything is changing
      content: My dad just quit his job, and it's weird to think that he won't be
        working at the same bank anymore. He's been working there since before I can
        remember, and it's going to take some getting used to. I'm happy for him,
        though, because he'll be able to take some time off and do what he wants to
        do, like farming. With graduation coming up, everything is changing, and it's
        hard to believe that we only have one year left. It feels like just yesterday
        we were freshmen, and now we're almost seniors. I'm going to miss the seniors
        who are graduating, but at the same time, it's a reminder that we're getting
        closer to the end of our high school career.
    - summary: I'm mad at my car for short circuiting
      content: I'm so mad at my car right now because it short-circuited, and now
        my power lock on the driver's side door doesn't work. I've been taking good
        care of my car, even washing it yesterday, and this is what happens. The worst
        part is that it keeps blowing the fuse, which also affects the gearshift,
        so every time I brake, my gearshift clicks, telling me it's ready to change
        gears, even when I'm going 50 MPH. I'm not looking forward to the cost of
        replacing the little motor inside the door, especially since Gillie Hyde doesn't
        even sell wiper blades for under $100. I'm just frustrated with my car right
        now, and I wish it would just work properly.
    - summary: I'm counting down the days until summer
      content: I only have two more days of school left, and I'm counting down the
        hours until summer. I'm so ready to be done with chemistry and all the other
        classes that I'm not really paying attention to anymore. I'm probably not
        even going to take the final in any of my other classes, which I know is bad,
        but I just can't wait for summer. I'm excited to have some freedom and be
        able to do what I want, without having to worry about homework and school
        responsibilities. Two more days, and I'll be free, and I couldn't be happier.

    - summary: I started a weight loss journey with friends
      content: I recently started a weight loss journey with my friends L and G, and
        we're all trying to reach our goal weights. I've already lost a few pounds,
        going from 168 to 164, and I'm feeling motivated to continue. My friends are
        also working towards their goals, with L wanting to lose 20 pounds and G aiming
        for the same. We're all in this together, and it's nice to have their support.
        I'm trying to stay on track with my low-carb diet, but it's not always easy.
        I had a setback when I threw up before work and realized I'd been living on
        beef jerky for three days, but I'm getting back on track. It's nice to have
        friends to share this journey with, and we're all rooting for each other to
        succeed.
    - summary: I am overworking myself
      content: I've been putting in too many hours at work, with 92 hours in just
        two weeks. I'm feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, and I'm not sure how I'll
        be able to keep this up. I agreed to work Wednesday and Thursday days, and
        then Friday and Saturday night shifts, which is just too much. I'm hoping
        I can make it through this period without burning out. I just want to be able
        to stay awake and get through my shifts without feeling like I'm running on
        empty.
    - summary: I am struggling with feelings of loneliness
      content: I've been feeling really lonely lately, and it's hard for me to admit
        it. I work a lot, and when I'm not working, I'm usually just walking my dog
        or playing video games. I don't have much of a social life, and it's taking
        a toll on me. I've been thinking about my life and wondering why I'm not good
        enough. I feel like I'm not skinny enough, smart enough, or charming enough,
        and it's hard for me to understand why men don't stay in my life. I just want
        someone to spend time with, to go on dates and have some companionship. I'm
        tired of being alone, and I'm hoping that something will change soon.
    - summary: I gave up my dog and I am feeling guilty
      content: I recently gave my dog, Max, to a friend, and I'm feeling really torn
        up about it. I think it was the right decision, because my friend will be
        able to give him more attention and care, but at the same time, I feel like
        I'm giving up. I'm worried that I'm not responsible enough to take care of
        a dog, and that's a hard thing for me to admit. I'm trying to convince myself
        that I made the right decision, but it's hard not to feel guilty. I'm hoping
        that time will tell, and that I'll be able to see that this was the best decision
        for both me and Max.
    - summary: I am frustrated with people who do not pick up after their dogs
      content: I was walking my dog, Max, the other day, and I saw so many piles of
        dog poop on the ground. It's disgusting, and it's especially bad in the Arizona
        heat. I don't understand why people can't pick up after their dogs. It's not
        that hard, and it's just common courtesy. I see people with huge dogs, and
        they just leave the poop there, like it's no big deal. It's not just the smell
        that's the problem, it's also the flies and the mess it makes. I just wish
        people would take responsibility for their pets and clean up after them.
    - summary: I am annoyed with children who behave badly in public
      content: I've noticed that some children behave really badly in public, and
        it's frustrating. They use bad language, throw rocks at cars, and don't even
        put their trash in the can. It's like their parents aren't teaching them any
        manners or discipline. I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like some
        parents are just not paying attention to their kids' behavior. I'm not trying
        to be judgmental, but it's just annoying to see kids acting out like that.
        I wish parents would take more responsibility for teaching their children
        how to behave in public.
    - summary: I started using a gentle leader for my dog
      content: I recently got a gentle leader for my dog, Max, to help him stop pulling
        on the leash. He hates it, but it's been really helpful. I'm able to walk
        him without him pulling me all over the place, and it's made our walks much
        more enjoyable. I'm glad I got it, even though Max isn't too happy about it.
        It's been a game-changer for our walks, and I'm hoping it will help him learn
        to walk nicely on a leash.
    - summary: I am trying online dating
      content: I've been feeling lonely lately, so I decided to try online dating.
        I signed up for eharmony.com, and I'm hoping it will help me meet someone
        special. I'm a little nervous, but I'm also excited to see what happens. I've
        been reading other people's blogs, and it seems like some of them have had
        success with online dating, so I'm hoping I'll be one of the lucky ones. I
        just want to find someone to spend time with, to go on dates and have some
        companionship. I'm tired of being alone, and I'm hoping that online dating
        will help me change that.
    - summary: I found a new job after three weeks of searching
      content: I'm relieved to have finally found a new job after three weeks of searching.
        I was starting to get worried that I wouldn't be able to find anything, but
        thankfully, I landed a job that I'm really excited about. I don't start until
        August 9th, but at least I have something to look forward to. I'm grateful
        to whoever suggested datefree.com, and I'm going to check it out now. I'm
        hoping that this new job will bring some stability and security into my life,
        and that I'll be able to meet new people and make some friends.
    - summary: I am reflecting on my life and feeling depressed
      content: I've been feeling really down lately, and I've been doing some reflecting
        on my life. I've been thinking about why I'm not good enough, and why men
        don't stay in my life. I feel like I'm not worthy, and that I'm just not enough.
        I've been trying to figure out what I can do to change the way I'm viewing
        things, but it's hard. I just want to feel like I'm good enough, like I'm
        worthy of love and attention. I'm tired of feeling alone, and I'm hoping that
        something will change soon. I just want to be happy, and to feel like I'm
        living a fulfilling life.

    - summary: I am moving to California and preparing for the move
      content: I was thinking about creating my own web site as a sort of online journal
        to keep in touch with friends and family once I move to California. But then
        I found Blogger, and this seems much easier. I've been very busy packing and
        coordinating my move from Mpls to CA. Lots and lots to do, only a couple weeks
        to get it all done. My gorgeous black leather sleeper sofa will be put into
        storage with several other things this Saturday. I've hired two guys and a
        cargo van to help with the task. Hopefully, everything will run smoothly.
        Still have the little details of finding a place to live and a job to work
        out.
    - summary: I have too much stuff and am struggling to pack
      content: I have waaaaaay too much stuff. I spent a good chunk of the day packing
        and then repacking boxes, determining what goes into storage, what goes to
        the Salvation Army and what goes to CA with me. I've already mailed 5 boxes
        to my friend's place in Camarillo. Now I'm wondering if I should mail my yarn.
        I don't like the idea, but not all decisions are easy to make. I think I may
        have to break down and buy that Kanga roof pouch after all. I wish I still
        had my Escort wagon! It's been another day of way too much caffeine. I'm on
        my second Dr Pepper right now. At least I'll work off some of the jitters
        by playing tennis with my friend, Julie, later on.
    - summary: I am cold and looking forward to moving to warm California
      content: I am sooooooooooo cold!  I'm wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt with
        a big blanket wrapped around me as I write this. The past few days have been
        unseasonably cold here in MN. It feels more like October than August. Here
        in August it's usually in the 80s with lots of humidity. Right now, it's only
        57 degrees! It's been as low as the 40s at night.  I'm not really superstitious,
        but today is Friday, the 13th. Let's see what today brings... I'm looking
        forward to being in sunny and warm California!
    - summary: I am preparing to move my stuff into storage
      content: Today's the 'move my stuff into storage' day.  Everything is ready.
        I'm waiting for the rental place to open so I can get the cargo van.  Last
        night, I had mojotos, hoagies and a movie at Mike and Sara's place. They gave
        me my own Mr. Wonderful. He says 'all the right things'! He'll definitely
        keep me company on my way out West. According to his packaging....    Mr Wonderful
        has been carefully developed with today's modern woman in mind. He is complete
        with good looks, sense of style, sensitivity, charm, and is genuinely sincere.
    - summary: I hate packing and am stressed about the move
      content: I hate packing. It's finally gorgeous outside and I'm inside packing.  Yesterday,
        the movers were behind schedule and showed up a half hour late. Surprisingly,
        they were able to load all of my stuff into the cargo van in 45 minutes. It
        all went well and without a hitch. Went out for Thai food with my brother
        and his family last night. Very good. Went over to his place to play with
        the baby and watch some of the Vikings' game. A bit stressed and anxious about
        the move...
    - summary: I had a bon voyage dinner with friends
      content: 'Last night my friends, Brenda and Sara, took me out for a bon voyage
        dinner at a nice restaurant in Minneapolis. We started discussing my blog,
        and Sara expressed disappointment in me not posting a photo of her in my Mr.
        Wonderful blog entry last week. I''ve become somewhat of a photojournalist
        now that I have my blog. Every time I go out, my camera accompanies me. Sara''s
        comment poses a few questions: 1) Is my blog ''the place'' to be seen now?
        Forget the exclusive bars downtown where you have to lay down three figures
        for a bottle of champagne just to get into the joint. Kelly''s blog gets you
        seen by all the cool cats in town!'
    - summary: I am planning my road trip to California
      content: The distance from Minneapolis to Camarillo is around 2,000 miles. I've
        spent the past couple of hours mapping out my route West. My earlier plans
        did not include the Mile High City. My ears can't handle high altitudes. The
        past couple of times I've driven through Denver have been excruciating for
        me. As shown in the map above, my earlier route included nights in Salt Lake
        City and Las Vegas. As of right now, I think I'm going to suck up the pain
        through Denver so I can spend a couple nights in Moab, Utah.
    - summary: I am cleaning and finding strange items
      content: OK. Obviously, I am taking this cleaning thing way too seriously. The
        items in the above photo were found behind my refrigerator. I wonder how long
        they have been there. I wonder if that little mouse was a special, homemade
        gift by someone's dearly loved grandma. I wonder if the fumes from my cleaning
        supplies are affecting my brain...
    - summary: I am reflecting on my decision to move to California
      content: Some people have asked me, 'Why are you doing this?' Why am I leaving
        my family and friends to venture out into the unknown? Without becoming too
        philosophical here, I believe I've been born cursed or blessed with a rambling
        spirit. California will be another adventure on my life's road. I'll keep
        you posted on how it goes. I've been wandering through this land, just doing
        the best I can, trying to find what I was meant to do.
    - summary: I had a frustrating experience with Time Warner Cable
      content: OK, here's my first flaming post...      Time Warner Cable sucks! Yesterday,
        I called to inform them I am disconnecting my internet access on August 27.
        So, that seems pretty straightforward, right? Moments after I talk to them,
        my modem stops working; I can't navigate anywhere. After restarting my computer
        and the modem with no change, I call the TWC helpdesk. The person can't fix
        it and sets up a service call for today 'between the hours of 11:00 and 2:00.'
    - summary: I attended the Corn Daze celebration and was on the local news
      content: 'Hello. I just returned from an extended weekend at my parents'' place
        in my hometown. Friday was the 43rd ''Corn Daze'' celebration at which the
        local canning factory supplied the event with all the free buttered corn-on-the-cob
        you could eat. I was a piggy; my total for the day was five ears: three for
        lunch and two for dinner. If you''ve never eaten corn-on-the-cob before, it
        can be very messy but definitely worth it... except when the local news station
        decides to include footage of your corn-eating piggy self on the 6:00 evening
        news, which is, unfortunately, exactly what happened to me.'

    - summary: I am struggling with depression and wondering if I need professional
        help
      content: I've been thinking about depression a lot lately and I'm starting to
        wonder if I might be clinically depressed. Over the last 10 months, I've been
        through a lot of tough times and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I
        feel like I'm strong enough to get through it, but I'm not sure how long it
        will last. I'm scared that my fears and emotions might end up crushing my
        psyche. I'm not sure when someone should seek professional help, but I'm considering
        it. I feel like I'm at a point in my life where I never thought I'd be, and
        it's becoming really scary. I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard when
        everything seems to be going wrong.
    - summary: I am frustrated with men who have commitment issues
      content: I've been dating men who have serious commitment issues and it's getting
        really frustrating. They seem to think that being an 'asshole' is the way
        to be liked, but it doesn't work for me. I just want someone who will treat
        me well, call me when they say they will, and admire me. I don't need material
        things, just someone who is genuine and caring. But all I seem to find are
        men who are commitment-phobic, emotionally unavailable, or just plain weird.
        I'm starting to wonder why I even bother with them. Is it because there are
        just so many of them out there, and if I didn't keep them around, I'd be single
        forever?
    - summary: I had a tough morning and am struggling with stress and hormones
      content: I woke up feeling really groggy and disoriented, like my brain was
        still asleep. I'd been up late the night before, crying and stressing about
        a guy friend who's been driving me crazy. I feel like I'm at my wit's end
        with him, and I just want to never talk to him again. But at the same time,
        I'm trying not to over-dramatize things. I think my stress and hormones are
        just getting the better of me. I started taking birth control pills and my
        hormones are all over the place. I'm crying, I'm tired, my boobs hurt... it's
        just a mess. I'm hoping that things will level out soon, but for now, I just
        feel like I'm a hot mess.
    - summary: I spent time with my family and felt better but still dealing with
        guy drama
      content: I recently took a vacation and spent some time with my family, which
        was really therapeutic for me. It was great to get away from everything and
        just relax with the people I love. My hormones seem to have leveled out a
        bit, and I'm not feeling as emotional as I was before. But, of course, the
        guy drama is still ongoing. He stood me up, and then had the nerve to call
        me late at night and act like everything was fine. I'm trying to take a stand
        and not answer his calls this week, but it's hard. I just want to be strong
        and move on from him, but it's not easy.
    - summary: I am trying to move on from a toxic relationship
      content: I've been dealing with this guy who is just toxic for me. He's always
        standing me up, ignoring me, and then acting like everything is fine. I'm
        trying to move on from him, but it's hard. I feel like I deserve better, but
        at the same time, I'm scared of being single. I'm trying to focus on myself
        and my own well-being, but it's hard when someone is still trying to pull
        me back in. I'm hoping that by not answering his calls and taking some time
        for myself, I'll be able to move on and find someone who actually cares about
        me.

    - summary: I gained weight after college and struggle with diet and exercise
      content: 'I graduated from college and started gaining weight, a lot of weight.
        Lots of ideas have been tossed around as to the cause. Maybe I have never
        eaten properly, but lots of exercise and activity had offset the negative
        habits. Maybe I became depressed and sought comfort in food. The result remains
        the same: I’m much heavier and less physically fit than I’ve ever been. For
        the last 2 years, I’ve been fighting and relapsing into my old ways. I read
        that poor diet and lack of exercise might end up killing more people than
        tobacco use and become the leading cause of preventable deaths in the USA
        by as early as next year. This is a sobering thought. I just thought that
        I was enjoying new and flavorful food that I never had been able to purchase
        on a high school and college student’s budget. I didn’t realize how bad the
        situation has become across the nation. I think I need to make a change and
        start eating healthier and exercising more regularly.'
    - summary: I am frustrated with my job and feel unfulfilled
      content: I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.
        I'm not sure what I want to do, but I know it's not this. I'm frustrated with
        my job and feel unfulfilled. I've been thinking about my life and what I want
        to achieve, but I'm not sure where to start. I feel like I'm just going through
        the motions and not really living. I need to make a change and start working
        towards my goals, but I'm not sure what those goals are yet.
    - summary: I want to lead a more exciting life and travel
      content: 'Every once in a while, I find myself thinking that it’d be nice to
        lead a more exciting life. I’m not sure what I deem to be more exciting. Maybe
        exciting means I want to get more life goals accomplished, travel to more
        exotic locals, go to more sporting or theater events, have a social life or
        meet more people from across the US or world. The problem is that I lead a
        fairly fast-paced life as it is. I travel pretty frequently both for work
        and for familial affairs. I see movies on a pretty regular basis. When there’s
        time, I watch sporting events on TV. I’d love to fit time in to volunteer
        somewhere, to read interesting books, or to go to school. I’m not sure where
        I’d fit it in… we don’t eat dinner until 9ish as it is. Honestly, my life
        is pretty cool. I do travel some neat places and see some neat things. We’re
        further ahead of the average person in terms of financial independence. I
        work for a company that does interesting governmental work. I have a wonderful
        husband and a crazy but interesting family. My car runs reliably and has a
        turbo, CD changer, sunroof, and heated seats. I do have good friends that
        I’ve known for over a decade. Maybe I’m happiest when I’m complaining about
        my life: not enough time, not as much money as I’d like, a job with not much
        satisfaction or intellectual stimulation, only human interaction is with co-workers
        and husband, out of shape, lack of life direction.'
    - summary: I attended an airshow and enjoyed it
      content: I went to an airshow in Rhode Island and it was great. The weather
        was beautiful, not too hot with a slight breeze. The planes were pretty amazing.
        The museum-type planes were sort of ho-hum, especially after a recent visit
        to the Museum of Flight near Seattle. However, the aerobatic planes did incredible
        maneuvers throughout the day. The USAF Thunderbirds were a great way to end
        the day. It's almost frightening how precise they are. If my life depended
        on that type of precision all of the time, I'd be in trouble. I was really
        looking forward to this for a little while now. Even with my love of things
        that fly, especially airplanes, I've never been to an airshow. This one looked
        pretty cool. The downside of it was the location. It's in Rhode Island and
        it'll take me about 2.5 hours to get there, not assuming traffic, and I want
        to be there for the opening parachute jump at 9:55.
    - summary: I have been thinking about my goals and feel pressure to achieve them
      content: I've been doing a lot of thinking about short-term and long-term goals
        lately. It's starting to bother me that I haven't even started down the paths
        to achieve some of them. I keep thinking about all the interviews I had that
        asked where I saw myself in 5 years. Well, 5 years has now become next year.
        Some of the people I went to high school with have achieved and accomplished
        what I hold to be pretty amazing things. Things I wouldn't mind trying. Learning
        new languages, advanced degrees, neat or unusual travel and jobs, etc. I've
        done some pretty cool stuff, but I'm not sure it's the kind of thing they
        write about in my smallish town paper. I've accomplished more than some, but
        less than others. That should be good, but I strive for more. My biggest problem
        is wanting to do, see, and understand everything. However, I never make any
        concrete decisions in terms of direction, so I wind up doing absolutely nothing.
        In some ways, it's procrastinating. In other ways, it's a severe case of indecisiveness.
    - summary: I attended a wedding and reflected on my own life
      content: I went to my husband's sister's wedding and it was nice to see the
        same people that were at our wedding, but without the hassle of being the
        bride and groom. Congrats to Kelly and Andy. They both seemed very excited
        and happy to begin their married life in the Bahamas. I've always been curious
        about the Bahamas because it's tropical, but doesn't take a lot of time to
        travel to. Apparently, the rainy season in the Bahamas is from May to October.
        After checking out weather.com, it seems the newlyweds have picked a bad week
        to vacation. It's warm, but there is a good chance of thunderstorms and rain
        every day this week. I guess being in the middle of both the hurricane and
        rainy season means I shouldn't think of visiting the Bahamas during this time
        of year. I keep thinking that I could use a short vacation to catch up on
        sleep and just relax. Something warm, involving a pool or beach would be nice.
        It's not going to happen, though. Things are starting to pick up a bit at
        work, and our weekends are either rainy or booked with other obligations.
    - summary: I am struggling with sleep and feeling overwhelmed
      content: I didn't feel too well last week. Some weird feeling. People kept asking
        if I was pregnant. What kind of question is that? If I was, would I tell people
        this soon? No. However, I am not pregnant, so I can fight that question off.
        My guess is I felt weird because I haven't been able to sleep very well for
        about a month now. No real reason why I couldn't sleep much. Just a frustrating
        situation. I'm still struggling with the idea that it very likely was the
        last time that I would see my grandma alive. Although she was doing really
        well when we saw her, she had last rites the day before we were there. I guess
        she was planning on dying Saturday. She didn't, but even still... I'm exhausted
        and feeling overwhelmed. I need to find a way to manage my time better and
        get more sleep.
    - summary: I am frustrated with my coworker's unprofessional email
      content: A comment made by a coworker yesterday has been bothering me. She sent
        an email to a client saying 'Soooo, ummmmm, 'Show me da money!' and later
        in the same paragraph... 'Where the hell's my money?' Even though we have
        a good relationship with this particular client, it still seems like it's
        stepping over some sort of client-contractor professional courtesy line. I
        don't think it's very professional to send an email like that to a client.
        It's not the kind of language you would use in a professional setting. I'm
        surprised she would send something like that, especially to a client.
    - summary: I am reflecting on my life and feeling a sense of discontent
      content: I've been thinking a lot about my life and what I want to achieve.
        I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm not sure what
        I want to do, but I know it's not this. I'm frustrated with my job and feel
        unfulfilled. I've been thinking about my goals and feel pressure to achieve
        them. I've been doing a lot of thinking about short-term and long-term goals
        lately. It's starting to bother me that I haven't even started down the paths
        to achieve some of them. I keep thinking about all the interviews I had that
        asked where I saw myself in 5 years. Well, 5 years has now become next year.
        I'm not sure what I want to do, but I know I need to make a change. I need
        to start working towards my goals and figuring out what I want to do with
        my life.
    - summary: I am trying to find meaning and purpose in my life
      content: I've been thinking a lot about my life and what I want to achieve.
        I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm not sure what
        I want to do, but I know it's not this. I'm frustrated with my job and feel

        asked where I saw myself in 5 years. Well, 5 years has now become next year.
        I'm trying to find meaning and purpose in my life. I want to do something
        that makes me happy and fulfilled. I'm not sure what that is yet, but I'm
        trying to figure it out. I'm trying to be more mindful and present in my life,
        and to focus on what's truly important to me.
