Based on the persona and the scenario, predict a contextually grounded and logically coherent response to the question. Write the answer in third person, and keep it approximately 90 words long.


      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a likely young adult, possibly male, residing in the UK, who is passionate and outspoken about the gaming industry, expressing frustration with pricing and corporate practices, while also seeking informed discussions and valuing transparency, with a tone that is critical and slightly sarcastic.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is comparing the prices of the Playstation Vita across different regions, noticing a significant disparity in pricing, with the US price being $249, Japan''s price being 24,940 yen ($311), and Europe''s price being 249 euros ($365), and is speculating that the UK price will be 249 pounds ($409), which the author believes is unfair and attributes to being "ripped off" by Sony, considering that all the devices are manufactured in China and shipped from the same location.'
    question: How will the author's perception of Sony and their pricing strategy affect their future purchasing decisions regarding the Playstation Vita and other Sony products?
    answer: The author has explicitly stated that if the pricing stays the same, they will personally not buy the Playstation Vita "on principle of being ripped off by Sony once again", indicating a strong negative emotional response to the perceived unfair pricing, which may not only deter them from purchasing the Playstation Vita but could also influence their decision to buy other Sony products in the future, as the author seems to have a history of feeling ripped off by Sony, suggesting a potential long-term impact on the author's brand loyalty and trust in Sony.

      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a creative and resourceful individual, likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, living in Texas, who enjoys DIY projects, such as repurposing old furniture and trying out new skincare routines. She is a curvy, 5''1" entrepreneur, size 8-10, who has recently lost weight and is still finding her personal style, often seeking advice on fashion and beauty from online communities. As someone who works from home, she is looking to upgrade her professional attire for a business trip to Paris, where she will be introducing her guidebook on wheelchair accessible travel. She values practicality and comfort, often prioritizing sensible clothing and shoes, while also appreciating unique, vintage-inspired jewelry with an antique or historical feel. Having struggled with skin issues like seborrheic dermatitis, she has developed a simple skincare routine and is interested in exploring new products and techniques, such as facial peels and masks, to achieve healthier, brighter skin.
      With a flair for writing and a passion for history, she is drawn to old, eclectic things and is not afraid to ask for help or advice from others, showcasing her friendly and curious nature. As she navigates her career and personal life, she is continually looking for ways to refine her style, simplify her belongings, and make the most of her experiences, whether that''s through purging her closet, finding affordable fashion alternatives, or discovering new skincare solutions.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author, a 5''1" curvy woman from Texas, is planning a week-long trip to Canada where she will experience sub-zero temperatures for the first time. She is concerned about dressing warmly without looking bulky and is seeking advice on how to layer her existing clothing, which includes boots, a jacket, jeans, black stretchy pants, oversized button-ups, scarves, warm gloves, and darn tough socks. She does not want to buy a whole new wardrobe as she lives in Texas and will not need it often.'
    question: How will the author manage to dress warmly and stylishly during her trip to Canada using her existing clothing, and what additional pieces should she consider investing in to stay warm in temperatures ranging from -5 to 10 degrees F?
    answer: The author can start by layering the clothing she already has, using her oversized button-ups, scarves, and warm socks to trap warm air and stay cozy. She can wear her boots and jacket as outer layers, and add gloves and a scarf to protect her hands and neck from the cold. To avoid looking like the Michelin man, she can try to balance her layers, wearing thinner layers under thicker ones, and using her scarves to add a pop of color and style to her outfit. Since she has a lot of scarves, she can use them to add warmth and texture to her outfits, and consider wearing a few thinner scarves layered under a thicker one for added warmth. She may also consider investing in a few key pieces, such as thermal tops and leggings, to wear under her existing clothing for extra warmth. By mixing and matching her existing clothing and adding a few strategic layers, the author should be able to stay warm and stylish during her trip to Canada.

Based on the persona and the scenario, predict a contextually grounded and logically coherent response to the question. Write the answer in third person, and keep it approximately 130 words long.


      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a male, initially in his early twenties, now likely in his late twenties, who has progressed from being a college student to working part-time and lifting weights, with a history of acne and weight fluctuations, valuing financial responsibility and seeking advice on various life aspects, from renting a house to managing debt and health issues.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author had an overdrawn checking account with Wells Fargo from 2 years ago, which they had forgotten about until they found an old email reminding them of the debt. The account was closed, either by the author or by Wells Fargo, and the author was billed a checking account fee. Despite this, the author was able to open a new bank account recently without any issues. The author is now concerned about the potential amount they may owe, considering the possibility of weekly overdraft fees, and is hesitant to call the overdraft department to inquire about the debt. The author has since moved to a different state and had also opened a college bank account with First Niagara without being notified of any outstanding debts.'
    question: What will the author find out about the amount they owe when they call the overdraft department tomorrow, and are there any potential risks or consequences for the author in calling to inquire about the debt?
    answer: The author will likely find out the exact amount they owe, which may include additional fees and charges accrued over the 2-year period. The author is worried that they might owe a significant amount, such as $2000, due to weekly overdraft fees. By calling the overdraft department, the author may risk being notified of a larger debt than they anticipated, which could potentially affect their credit score or lead to further action from Wells Fargo to collect the debt. However, it is also possible that the amount owed is still relatively small, and the author will be able to resolve the issue without significant consequences. The author's decision to call and inquire about the debt is motivated by a desire to clarify their financial situation and avoid any potential future complications.

      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a thoughtful and introspective individual, likely a young adult, who is passionate about reading and discussing literature, particularly contemporary fiction and classics. As a person of color who has experienced racism, they bring a unique perspective to their analysis of books, often finding resonance with characters who have faced similar struggles. They are not a native English speaker, having learned it as their third language, which sometimes presents challenges when tackling complex literary styles, such as James Joyce''s. The user values authenticity and realism in character development, and is critical of authors who rely on trauma as a convenient plot device, as seen in their nuanced critique of Hanya Yanagihara''s writing. With a dry sense of humor and a tendency to be self-deprecating, they share their personal struggles, such as skin care concerns and frustrations with audiobooks, in a relatable and endearing way. Having recently read A Little Life, they are
      now seeking book recommendations that feature friendships and city life, preferably set in New York City, and are open to suggestions from others, as long as romance is not the primary focus.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is struggling to read James Joyce''s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, finding the style and tone of the narration to be particularly challenging due to the incorporation of poetry and the unique narrative voice that discusses other characters'' personalities without leaving the protagonist''s perspective. The author, a non-native English speaker, has tried listening to an audiobook to make the experience easier but is still finding it difficult to progress beyond a few pages. The author has a background of reading classics without much struggle but is finding Joyce''s work to be distinctly different.'
    question: How might the author adjust their reading approach to better understand and appreciate James Joyce's unique narrative style in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, given their struggles with the poetic language and complex character portrayals?
    answer: The author might consider taking a more patient and immersive approach to reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, potentially by slowing down their reading pace to fully absorb the poetic language and complex narrative structures. Additionally, the author could supplement their reading with external resources, such as literary analyses or study guides, to gain a deeper understanding of Joyce's intentions and the historical context of the novel. It might also be helpful for the author to re-read certain passages multiple times, taking notes on the narrative voice and character developments to clarify their understanding. Furthermore, joining a book club or discussing the novel with others who have read it could provide valuable insights and different perspectives, helping the author to navigate the challenges of Joyce's unique style and to appreciate the novel's nuances more fully.

      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a young male, likely in his early twenties, struggling with social awkwardness, schizophrenia, and low self-esteem, often finding solace in intimate relationships, but grappling with commitment and honesty, while navigating complex emotions and seeking connection.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is in a relationship with a girlfriend who loves and understands him, including his struggles with schizophrenia. However, during heated arguments, she takes his medication, Olanzapine, which he needs to stay connected to reality. This behavior forces him to visit her and make up, as he cannot function without his medication. Despite feeling that she loves him and is not manipulative, her actions significantly affect him, making him feel like he cannot argue or express himself without being accused of having a mental episode. The author values their relationship deeply, appreciates her understanding of his mental health, and fears losing her.'
    question: How might the author approach his girlfriend about her behavior of taking his medication during arguments without accusing her of having ill intentions or hurting her feelings, considering the importance of their relationship and her unique understanding of his mental health struggles?
    answer: The author might consider having an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about how her actions affect him, focusing on his feelings and needs rather than accusing her of manipulation. He could explain that while he understands she might feel overwhelmed during arguments, taking his medication not only jeopardizes his mental health but also makes him feel invalidated and unheard. By expressing his love and appreciation for her understanding and support, he can create a safe space for her to understand his perspective. It would be crucial for him to listen to her side as well, to understand why she feels compelled to take such actions during arguments, and together they could work on finding healthier ways to manage their conflicts that respect both their needs and feelings. The author's approach should emphasize the importance of their relationship, his reliance on his medication for his well-being, and his desire to find a solution that strengthens their bond rather
      than straining it.

      and more substantial gameplay reveals in trailers, reflecting their desire for a more authentic and enjoyable gaming experience. With a self-aware and slightly humorous tone, they acknowledge the challenges of balancing their gaming habits with adult responsibilities, such as job searching and portfolio building, and are eager to receive feedback and improve their design skills.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is expressing frustration with games that promise a rich dialogue experience but ultimately provide dialog options that do not significantly impact the game''s response or result, with the exception of one option that leads to a negative outcome. The author has encountered this issue multiple times and is aware of the challenges of game development and writing. The author values the idea of making meaningful choices in games.'
    question: What does the author think game developers should do to improve the dialogue experience in their games, given the author's desire for choices to have a significant impact on the game's outcome?
    answer: The author likely thinks that game developers should prioritize creating dialog options that lead to distinct and meaningful consequences, rather than simply providing the illusion of choice. The author wants their decisions to influence the game's story, characters, or environment in a noticeable way, making the gameplay experience more immersive and engaging. By doing so, game developers can create a more satisfying and interactive experience for players like the author, who crave a sense of agency and consequence in their gaming experiences. The author's awareness of the challenges of game development and writing suggests that they may be willing to accept some limitations, but still expect a certain level of depth and responsiveness in the game's dialogue system.

      The user is a European individual who has recently relocated to Seattle, marking a significant career shift and personal milestone in their life. Having left behind their home country, they are navigating the complexities of financial management in the US, including setting up bank accounts, filing taxes, and managing income from both a full-time job and a part-time self-employment arrangement. As they settle into their new life, they are seeking to understand the nuances of the US financial system, from credit unions and bank accounts to investment options and tax obligations. With a gross income of $108,600, comprising $75,000 from their Seattle employer and $33,600 from their part-time European client, they are diligently working to ensure a stable financial foundation, while also considering the needs of their family back in Europe, to whom they regularly send money and for whom they are also responsible for a mortgage. Their emotional tone is one of practical concern and a desire
      for clarity, as they work to build a new life in the US and potentially pursue US citizenship. As they balance their professional and personal responsibilities, they are taking steps to educate themselves about financial planning, including the differences between savings accounts and investment options, such as those offered by Merrill, and the implications of these choices for their long-term financial security.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is moving to Seattle from Europe and is researching financial setup options in the US, specifically looking into bank accounts and credit unions, as they are not familiar with the latter but have read that they are more customer-focused, and is seeking suggestions for the best setup upon arrival.'
    question: What steps should the author take to set up their finances in Seattle, including choosing a bank account and navigating other financial aspects in the US?
    answer: The author should consider visiting a credit union in person to learn more about their services and how they differ from traditional banks, as they are more customer-focused, and ask about the types of accounts they offer, such as checking and savings accounts, and any associated fees, as well as inquiring about other general suggestions for managing finances in Seattle and the US, including options for transferring money from Europe, understanding tax implications, and getting familiar with the US financial system, and it would be beneficial for the author to also research and compare different credit unions and banks in Seattle to find the one that best suits their needs, and to reach out to their current bank in Europe to inform them of their move and ask about any international banking services they may offer, and to consider setting up a US bank account before arriving in Seattle to make it easier to receive payments and pay bills, and to also look into other financial aspects
      such as getting a US credit card, understanding credit scores, and learning about any specific financial regulations or laws in the US that may affect them as an international resident.

She may also think about her husband's personal style and preferences, as well as his current weight and fitness goals, in order to choose a pair that will make him feel confident and comfortable.

They express admiration for leaders who take a strong stance, like those in Texas, and show support for self-defense laws and school security measures, exemplified by their approval of Sgt. Perry''s actions in a self-defense scenario. The user''s discourse is peppered with vivid imagery and metaphors, such as picturing a political figure in a memory care facility, fabricating stories, which underscores their creative and sometimes sarcastic approach to expressing dissent. Throughout their posts, the user consistently advocates for what they see as righteousness and freedom, willing to "lay down my life in defense of our Republic," highlighting a deep commitment to their beliefs and values.


      Here''s the scenario:

      The author is reflecting on the current geopolitical situation, specifically the actions of North Korea and the response of Japan, in the context of what they perceive as a weak and distracted U.S. regime. The author mentions that the "madman in North Korea" frequently launches missiles, which led to Japan issuing an alert that was quickly retracted. This incident, according to the author, illustrates how global leaders they consider to be "lunatics" have become more daring due to the perceived weakness of the U.S. regime.'
    question: How does the author think the international community should respond to the actions of nations like North Korea, given their view of the current U.S. regime's inability to effectively address these issues?
    answer: The author seems to imply that a stronger, more focused U.S. regime would be more effective in deterring the actions of nations like North Korea. They suggest that the current state of global affairs, with the U.S. being "pathetically weak and socially distracted," has emboldened other nations to act more aggressively. Therefore, the author would likely advocate for a more robust and engaged U.S. foreign policy that could counterbalance the influence of these nations and provide a more stable and secure environment for other countries. This could involve strengthening alliances, enhancing military capabilities, and engaging in more effective diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of these geopolitical tensions.

      Here''s the scenario:

      The author had a chance encounter with Marco Dermith after their Friday radio program, where Marco gifted them some drawings of historical Black freedom fighters and shared words of inspiration, and the author signed Marco''s copy of their book "No More Cursing Destroying the Roots of Religious Racism", leaving a significant impression on the author.'
    question: How did this encounter with Marco Dermith and the exchange of gifts and inspirational words affect the author's thoughts on their work and its impact on others?
    answer: The encounter seemed to have a profound effect on the author, as they were honored to sign Marco's copy of their book, indicating that the author values Marco's appreciation and admiration for their work.

The author's positive reaction to the encounter and the gift may have reinforced their belief in the importance of their work and its potential to inspire and educate others. The inspirational words shared by Marco may have also motivated the author to continue their efforts to address religious racism, leaving a lasting impact on their thoughts and feelings about their work.

      Here''s the user''s persona:

      The user is a likely male individual, possibly in his mid-to-late twenties or thirties, who has faced various physical challenges, including a knee injury from a clash about three years prior to 2016 and recurring pressure sores due to medical issues, which have prompted him to seek advice on strengthening his knee and finding a comfortable PC chair with ample butt cushioning. As a self-employed individual or someone who works from home, he spends a significant amount of time on his computer, necessitating a reliable and efficient setup, which led him to consider upgrading his PC with a faster processor to take full advantage of his newly installed fast fibre broadband. His profession or hobby as a goalkeeper has also driven his desire to improve his power, explosiveness, and stamina, particularly in recovering from sprinting and other physically demanding activities. Having experienced a recent low point due to severe skin issues, which may be related to psoriasis, he has mustered
      the courage to shave his head, allowing his skin to breathe and facilitating more effective treatment applications, demonstrating his resilience and determination to overcome adversity. Throughout his online interactions, he comes across as a resourceful and proactive individual who values the input and advice of others, often seeking help and expressing gratitude for the support he receives from the community.

      Looking for an extremely butt comfy PC chair, medical issues - need help!


      Hey! So basically I have an issue with my butt, I get pressure sores when sat on a hard surface for a long time, however - I work from my PC and PC game so.. I spend a fair time on my ass, I need a PC chair with a lot of butt cushion which won''t disappear in a few months.


      I was looking at this - has anyone had experience? How is butt comfort?


      Can you suggest anything else? Please help - I didn''t know if this was the right place but I''m hoping you guys can help.


      Thanks!

      Post 2:

      I posted a while back about my bad skin, today I found out just how bad it was...


      I''ve never been at such a low point before, still plenty of things to try, waiting on a referral to come through, but it''s getting panned off as psoriasis, I have my doubts, what are your thoughts?


      I''ve never shaved my head ever, but I think this will be a good thing, it can breathe and I can apply treatment much more effectively, it hurts though.'
    question: Now you want to write a post because your PC with a 1.6 GHz processor hasn’t improved page load times despite upgrading to fast 95+ megabit broadband. Confused by the lack of noticeable difference from the previous 25 meg speed, you seek advice on possible upgrades to better utilize the faster connection.
    answer: 'PC Upgrade??


      Hi, new to this so be gentle, I have a pc with only a 1.6 Ghz processor and have just got fast fibre broadband but don''t seem to notice a big difference on loading pages from the last 25meg speed to the now 95 meg plus speed, any ideas of a pc upgrade please??


      Thanks in advance, Rich'

Match the user's writing style, tone, and perspective based on their previous content. Ensure the new post is contextually relevant, coherent, and consistent with the user's voice. Write about 140 words.\n\nHere are the user's past posts:\nPost 1:\nSapporo and Hong Kong with kids\n\nThe boys (14 and 9) and I are headed to Sapporo to visit friends next week. Yes, but friends will be working, and we will need to entertain ourselves. So, ideas of neat places to see while there? Also our return has 21 hours in Hong Kong (8 of which will be sleeping). I read a lot of articles about bars and nightlife in Hong Kong, but what can I do with these two? I want them to see it too!\n\nThirdly, this is the longest plane flight we'll do (14 hours). Our previous record was 11 from LHR to SFO. We travel internationally at least once a year, but it's a 6 hour flight. I'm fairly\
      \ well versed, but is there anything extra we should know about the longer flight? They've both been traveling since they were babies, and are excellent on planes (a woman on our last flight, who rolled her eyes when she saw my then 7-year-old sitting behind her, commented at the end of the flight \"I forgot he was there!\"). But 14 hours is a long time to keep them occupied! Trying to travel light, not have a lot of electronics with us.\nPost 2:\nIce dam(s) causing dripping through ceiling\n\nI got ice dams, whoa do I. New roof and insulation scheduled for this spring, but for now, it's dripping into the kitchen through the ceiling, and also from the frames of the windows.\n\nI can't get a pro out here to steam it away, I live on an island. Roof melt might work, and pantyhose thing, does that really work? This thing is almost a foot thick. Plus that's not the one that's dripping into the kitchen, the one there is under a metal roof, and is coming in somehow.\n\nI am too damn scared\
      \ to get up on a slippy metal roof in winter (call me a fool). How do I fix an ice dam I can't see? I know it's there because I see an icicle coming from the middle, under the metal roof.\n\nI live in the northeast, and have raked my roof as best as possible. We've gone a whole 3 days with no snow (miracle!) so I'm hoping the sun melts some more today.\n\nAny other ideas gratefully received.\n\nYes, I've looked at the ST Structures page.\nPost 3:\nIWTL how to stop picking at my fingers\n\nMy fingers are trashed. My nails are splitting, my cuticles are bloody and sore. I hate it, but I can't stop. I've been told this is an OCD behavior, but I feel like I can control it. \n\nWhen I'm super stressed (which right now is basically every day), I pick to relieve stress. Plus I'm in a different environment from what I'm used to, it's much drier here. I do put on lotion, but forget a lot of the time.\n\nAny tips or tricks out there I can try? Please don't suggest the bad tasting nail polish\
      \ stuff. Last time I used it I somehow got some on my tongue. I did drop about 10 pounds that week, since everything tasted like crap.\nPost 4:\nCan't figure out if I should sell or rent my house\n\nThere's a huge backstory to this, but basically I would need to put in at least $30,000 in repairs to bring it up to speed for renting. It's a nice house in a fantastic location, just had it valued and it's around $575,000, but because of the location and housing shortage here there's a good chance it would go for more. I could fix it up and rent it for between $2,000-$3,000 a month.\n\nTaxes on renting would be around $5,000 a year, not including the property management company fee, registering with the rental board here, or accountants fees. The capital gains tax would work out to $3,000 if I sold. Also, if I sold I would be able to drop around $1,000 in accountants fees because I live in a different country to the house, and I need accountants to file for me.\n\nI own this property free\
      \ and clear.\n\nWhat am I missing on this?\n\nThere is a great personal attachment to the house, but I am trying to leave that aside and look solely at the numbers.\nPost 5:\nWant to learn DIY\n\nI am terrified of doing it tho, and of screwing up! I have a long list of things I want to do/make... including gardening, repair of fences, moving a pellet stove and chimney, a goat house and yard, and a rocket stove. \n\nIdeas on where I should start? I get overwhelmed easily, but as a single mom and homeowner, I gotta get this stuff done..."
    question: Now you want to write a post because you’re moving from Ireland to the US and need to transfer funds from closed accounts and a house sale via wire without triggering money laundering red flags. You worry the government might seize funds and seek reassurance about legal limits to avoid issues during the transfers.
    answer: 'Limits on money transfer into the US?


      Hi there, I am in the process of shutting down my life in Ireland and transferring the money from those accounts into my account in the US. Also, I''m selling my house there and need to get that money over to the US as well.


      I have no problem transferring money by wire. Do it all the time, not an issue.  BUT, I have some memory of there being a monetary limit on the amount of money that can come into the US at once, without sending up a red flag. I think something to do with money laundering legislation?


      Anyway, just checking to see if this rings a bell with anyone else. Also have a memory of the US gov seizing money, and really would like that to not happen!


      Thanks!'

Started a new \"casual attire\" job and need to get up to speed asap\n\nHi, \n\nI just transitioned from a professional attire office of mostly 40-somethings to a casual attire creative marketing agency of mostly 20-somethings. I'm 24 and plus sized. \n\nFor my first couple days, I wore patterned skirts with drapey tops, which is apparently still too dressy. My boss took me aside today and told me I need to dress way down from now on - she told me I need to wear denim by the end of the week. (And it didn't sound like a friendly \"hey feel free to wear jeans if you want!\" but like \"Get in line with office culture\
      \ asap\".) \n\nIn my old job, I worked 7 days a week, so I have professional clothes and pajamas. I have one pair of jeans. To put a further wrench in it, I'm going from a nonprofit salary and I only have $200 to spend. What's the best way to curate a casual wardrobe in a hurry? Should I just head to Forever 21 to get a few items to hold me over until I have the money for better quality?\nPost 2:\nWhat should my BF wear to a nighttime networking event (in advertising/PR/marketing)?\n\nHi everyone - this is my first post ever, but I thought I'd start here because my boyfriend loves this website.\n\nSo, my boyfriend asked me to buy him an outfit for networking in advertising/PR/marketing as his Christmas present. Everyone I know in that industry is a hipster, which my bf definitely is not. So my question is - what outfit would look really sharp for a nighttime networking event? (Hopefully this could double as a work outfit, but doesn't have to.)\n\nHe's in his early 20s, reddish-brownish\
      \ hair and tan skin, and is pretty husky. His normal style is a superhero t-shirt with jeans for casual days, and black slacks with a white button-down (no tie) for professional days.\n\nI was thinking of getting him some cufflinks, a chunky watch, and some silk shirts - but I've seen mixed reviews on all of those things for young men. My budget for his gift is about $300. Any thoughts?"
    question: Now you want to write a post to ask if sticking to mid-1960s retro styles (like Betty Draper) would make your wardrobe seem too costume-like, recalling your teenage phase of wearing Halloween costumes daily. You love this silhouette but worry overcommitting to it—or even twee patterns—might look staged, questioning if mixing other styles is needed to avoid that look.
    answer: 'Would it be too costume-y to only buy clothes in a retro silhouette?


      I have never had a wardrobe that I loved, except for briefly as a teenager when I literally wore Halloween costumes every day for a year. (My poor mother... I really should give her more hugs.)


      I''ve finally found a style I like, which is mid-1960s suburban woman (ie, Betty Draper). If I look back at photos of myself and find the outfits that feel most flattering, they fit this silhouette.


      But before I get all shop-happy and only buy things with this shape/style in mind, would that look too costume-y? (I wouldn''t buy only retro pieces, but I am certainly attracted to twee patterns...) Do I need to find another decade/style to mix in? I don''t want to look like I''m wearing costumes every day again!'

Maybe 7k? Then just make payments? Or is there a better way of doing this.\nPost 2:\nShould I get a credit card?\n\nJust getting my own place in January, I’m 19 and in school, and have never owned a credit card. It seems to be “common knowledge” that you\
      \ should get a credit card and just make purchases and pay it off on time to build good credit score, but I’ve also seen a lot of people say that’s not actually how it works.\n\nShould I get one and just hold it?

    question: Now you want to write a post because your girlfriend battles body dysphoria despite her natural beauty. She strives for a slender, flat-chested figure, losing curves through extreme dieting and exercise, but genetics hinder her ideal look, fueling her frustration. Your constant reassurances are met with resistance, leaving you helpless to ease her dissatisfaction and seeking advice on supporting her as her partner.
    answer: 'I dont know how I can help with my girlfriends body dysphoria


      The title makes it sound like I''m trying to play the victim but that''s not what I mean. My girlfriend is gorgeous, and not just in a "because shes my girlfriend" type of way, like she is actually beautiful, and I tell her that all the time, but she has very strange standards for beauty. She has this picture in her mind of what she wants to look like, and its not really a typical type of picture.


      What I mean is that most girls want like, a small waist, big butt, nice boobs, but my girlfriend wants to be slender, small waist, nice butt, no boobs.


      She used to have a great figure, hourglass shape, fantastic "assets" and whatnot, but that style doesnt fit her ideal body type so she started going to the gym and lost a bunch of weight, and with that lost weight, she also lost her boobs (which she wanted to lose) and a fair chunk off her behind (which she didnt want to lose). And this has put her in a strange middle ground where she wants to look a certain way, but because of genetics, she may just not be able to look like that. and so she is just unhappy with how she looks, and constantly complains. I always try and help her and make her feel as beautiful as she actually is, but she cant take any kind of encouragement. She will take a complement, but every time I try and help her with this body dysphoria, she always constantly shoots me down, and I dont know how to help her because it''s not like anything I say can make her feel better, and I obviously cant just make her look the way she wants, but I need to help her somehow.


      Anyone who''s been in this situation have any advice on how to deal with this, from a partner''s standpoint?'

      Should I worry about the length of PHAT workouts?


      I''m starting PHAT this week after doing 5/3/1 training for the past 8 months or so.  My workouts have always been roughly 40 minutes.  Yesterday I did the power leg workout exactly as prescribed in the template.  It took me about 40 minutes.  I warmed up for 3 sets of squats beforehand.  I see most people saying it takes about an hour or more per workout, but I just can''t see myself spending that much time in the gym.  Does it matter if I cut my time down to under 45 minutes for hypertrophy days as well?  This is assuming I bang out all of the sets and reps in the workout program as it''s designed.

      Can I do serious damage to my thumbs with the hook grip (dead lifts)?


      I know the hook grip takes some time to get used to, and it''s supposed to hurt at first.  I''m fine with the pain, but is there a chance I destroy my thumbs?  I can only get one or two fingers over my thumb when pulling, and it puts tremendous pressure on them, especially under the nail.  Yesterday, I pulled 275 for 10 reps and my thumbs are still in pain today, and the nails are purple.

      Post 3:

      Do I need to change my calorie intake throughout my cut?


      I used IIFYM to calculate my calories for this cut.  This is my first ever strict cut.  I started at 170 lbs., 1900 calories max per day.  Working out 6 days per week, including push/pull weight training and HIIT every other day.  I must''ve had a terrible diet during my bulk because I''ve already dropped 5 lbs. this week.  Should I keep doing 1900 calories for the next 12 weeks?  I''m thinking I need to cut down to 1800 to continue to see results.

      How difficult is it to actually produce a board game, and get major licensing?


      I''ve always wanted to design a board game.  Came up with a great idea for one, which would require major brand licensing.  Wondering if anyone has tried to do this on their own, or knows a bit about the industry.  I think the idea is great, and I could work on it entirely in my free time until ready for production, but am a bit clueless in the entrepreneurial department.'
    question: Now you want to write a post because you crave Thai food while on a calorie-restricted diet, aiming to stay under 1900 daily. You split curry dishes like panang or green curry with rice into two meals but lack calorie info. Nervous about overeating, you estimate half a portion might be 500 calories and seek confirmation to stay on track.
    answer: 'Help with counting calories in Thai food


      I''m addicted to Thai food.  Since I started my cut almost 3 weeks ago, I haven''t had ANY.  I''m nervous about keeping my calories under 1900 every day.  So far, I''ve been super diligent, haven''t gone over once.  I''m debating getting some Thai food for lunch.  It''s cheap, close to work, and very satisfying.  I just can''t seem to find any information about calories anywhere.  I usually get some sort of curry dish like panang or peanut curry, but I divide it in half and eat it again for dinner.  Anyone have a source or estimate of any kind?


      Edit: If I had to GUESS, I''d say a half dish of some green curry with veggies and beef is about 500 calories, including the rice?'

      TIFU by writing to another co-worker in my boss''s birthday card.


      This happened at lunch today.  I have successfully cringed myself into a ball so tight that I think a black hole is beginning to form where my heart once resided.  In my office we always do the proverbial "Office Space" birthday celebration.  You know the kind where everybody signs a generic birthday message in a card and then shows up for cake at 1 o''clock and mumbles out "Happy Birthday".  It is honestly depressing sometimes.


      Well, earlier today I was intensely focused on a project I''ve been working on when a co-worker comes and drops off a card for me to sign before lunch.  I didn''t fully hear who the card was intended for, but I know one of my coworkers has a birthday this month and I just assumed it was for him.  I wrote a little quip about how he should be a good coworker because I''m going to be his boss someday (it was an obvious joke that makes sense in the context of our relationship, he is like 10 years my senior at this company).  I''m feeling all good thinking my coworker is going to get a laugh out of it.


      Eventually 1 o''clock comes around and I''m hankering for some cake.  I stroll over to the kitchen area where the rest of my department has congregated to enjoy the birthday festivities- but mostly for the ice cream cake.  I thought it was weird as I stood facing my coworker that everybody began singing happy birthday facing a different direction.  I turn my head and see that this party was not intended for my coworker.  It was intended for my boss.  At first I didn''t realize my fuck up, and if this next part hadn''t happened, I probably wouldn''t have even realized my fuck up.  After blowing out the candles my boss opens the card and begins to read aloud some of the notes we wrote inside.  This is when I realized I had made a fatal error.  My boss begins reading my message and gives me a confused look when it says that she better be on good behavior if she wants a promotion once I''m her boss.  Someone stifled a laugh like they thought it was an intentional joke, but nobody else
      laughed.  Everybody just stared at me as my boss read a seemingly condescending note I wrote to her in her birthday card.  My boss just gives me a "wtf" look and rhetorically says "is this some kind of joke?" and puts down the card and the cake slicing begins.  I quietly took my slice and bolted out of there.


      I haven''t seen my boss since the incident, but I''m really not looking forward to having to explain why I told her she was going to be my subordinate in the future.


      I thought I was signing a birthday card for my coworker, not my boss.  Boss then reads my plan to steal her job from her in front of the entire department.

      TIFU by eating my friend''s ice cream.


      This FU happened during my senior year of high school, about 10 years ago.  Back then my friends and I were all about practical jokes.  Nothing crazy, but lots of shenanigans like playing with firecrackers or covering a room with cups full of water.  We were harmless, yet immature little shits.


      One of our favorite ways of screwing with each other was messing with someone else''s food during lunch.  We were fucking ruthless.  You couldn''t eat chips without the risk of somebody trying to break the chip in your hand as you transport it from the bag to your mouth.  We would also play this game where if you left your sandwich on the table unprotected, somebody would shout "what''s *THIS?*" and jam their finger into your sandwich.  I have fucking PTSD whenever I eat food in a crowded place because of these "hunger games".


      Well, one day a friend of mine buys his lunch from the cafeteria and comes out with a soft-serve ice cream cone.  We''re all eyeballing this thing as he says that he has to go back to the cafeteria and get some silverware.  When he leaves, we''re all staring at this magical ice cream cone thinking about what we''re going to do to it.  "*What a fool to leave such a precious thing unattended,*" I pondered to myself.  And this is where the fuck up happens.  It turns out that the rest of my friends had colluded before lunch that day and decided that they would try to egg me on and get me to do something to this damn ice cream cone.  Being the little shit that I was, I didn''t even hesitate.  They suggested that I should "Bite off the bottom of the ice cream cone" so my friend would have to eat it quick or risk it melting all over the table.


      "*Genius,*" I thought to myself, "*he''ll be dripping ice cream everywhere.*"  I grabbed the ice cream and bit off the entire bottom of the cone.  By now it is too late.  The trap has been sprung, and I could not escape the anguish and humiliation I earned for deciding to bite into another man''s ice cream cone.  This is when I discovered that before filling this cone with ice cream, my friend gave it a solid 2-inch helping of mustard.


      Mustard. Fucking. Everywhere.  It dripped all over the front of me and squirted out of the corners of my mouth.  I ran for the bathroom to try to minimize the damage, but it already ruined my awesome Donald Duck shirt.  Yeah I wore a Donald Duck shirt to school, it was fucking badass until it looked like Donald pissed himself.  We laughed it off that afternoon.  I bare-butt farted on his pillow, so we were even.  Damn, I hate 17 year old me.


      Anyway, 2/10 would not eat my friend''s ice cream cone again.  Thank god it wasn''t fucking mayonnaise.


      TL;DR I bit off the bottom of my friend''s ice cream cone, turns out it was a trap and the cone exploded mustard into my mouth.

      Are figeater larvae a gardening nuisance? (Southern California)


      I just moved into a new home in Southern California and was excited to plant some vegetables and herbs in one of the planter boxes in my back yard.  I started mixing up the soil and noticed some white grubs (about 2 inches long, they curl up in a tight ''C'' shape when you pull them out).  There was quite a few of them, as after I mixed up the soil, it appeared several areas were still moving after I was done mixing (kind of creepy looking).


      After doing some research through my local gardening society, I believe they are figeater larvae.  From what I''ve read they are good for compost, but could potentially be an issue for your garden if there is a large number of them as they compete with the roots for nutrients.


      Have any of you had experience with figeater larvae?  Did you have to get rid of them?  If so, how did you go about doing that?  I would like to avoid pesticides if possible, and want to keep them to this garden bed, as I have other areas in my yard that don''t have the larvae.


      Any thoughts would be helpful!


      Edit: here is a picture.  I know it''s hard to really see it because it''s covered in dirt.  I''ll see if I can get another one and clean it off and post that as well.

      TIFU by wearing the wrong shorts in a public bathroom.


      This actually happened today at lunch. On mobile, so my apologies for formatting. I am an American, but I have been traveling through Europe on vacation for the past week. As an American, I find Europe fascinating. Everything is much older, very beautiful, and just done differently. Probably the biggest difference as a tourist is getting used to the currency. In the States we have $1 coins, but they''re rarely used. Here in Europe, my wallet has slowly been filling up with .50, 1, and 2 coins all week long. I don''t know why I haven''t been using them, but my wallet has been starting to get heavy from it.


      Today after lunch I went to use the restroom inside a small cafe. Bathrooms are the other major difference in Europe. Many of them are VERY tiny, especially if they are located in a little cafe. This particular bathroom was so small that my shoulders were touching both walls to my left and right as I did my business. As this is transpiring, my shorts (which are made out of a lightweight fabric so they can dual as swim trunks) began sliding off my waist due to the excess of coins.


      Because the bathroom was so small, there was nothing I could do to bend and grab them after they fell past my knees. Oh well, the cafe isn''t busy, I''ll just finish up and back up and fix this when I''m done, nobody will see. Well, that''s when an older man walked into the dimly lit bathroom behind me. I don''t know if he didn''t see my predicament, or just didn''t care because he just stood there watching me.


      At this time I am feeling weirded out that another gentleman is behind me while my pants are around my ankles. When I finish I try to resolve my wardrobe issue as soon as possible. However, in my haste and restrained position, I accidentally bent down too quick and smacked my forehead on the urinal, causing an audible clank. The man then seemed to understand the situation as I turn around holding my head with my shorts at my feet. He gave me a disgusted look, turned around and left.


      I exited the bathroom several minutes later after washing my forehead with soap and hot water to make sure I didn''t have a face anymore and I am now dead inside. The cafe owner gave me strange looks when I exited, but he doesn''t need to worry. I''ll just never show my face in this country ever again.


      TL;DR Wore shorts today, they fell to my ankles as I used the restroom. A man watched me and I hit my head on the urinal. Still, 10/10 will visit Belgium again.'
    question: Now you want to write a post confessing you accidentally collided with a young boy while playing frisbee at a windy beach, sending him flying. You feel horrified and guilty after his shocked silence and his mother’s icy rebuke, aware of the tension as the only Black family nearby. You apologize but fear their lasting anger, haunted by the incident’s severity and your size’s role in it.
    answer: 'TIFU by destroying a small child.


      I fu''d about 5 years ago, and as a result I think I traumatized a child for the rest of his life.


      I was at the beach with some friends in Southern California playing frisbee.  On this particular day it was extremely windy, and our frisbee was being blown all over the place.  My friend throws me a wild disc and I decide I''m not going to not catch it.  So I''m all out sprinting (and I''m on the wet sand where you can at least get some decent speed).  I''m tracking the bee up above and am about to grasp it when suddenly a hard THUD and I''m somersaulting to the ground.  I look up and I see a little boy splayed out on the ground about 5-6 feet away from where we collided.  I didn''t see it, but I''m told that the kid was literally punted into the air.  I''m a big guy, about 6''6", 225lbs.  I thought he''s definitely dead.


      Surprisingly, he gets back up and runs behind his mom who saw everything.  He must have been in shock because he didn''t start crying until about a minute after everything happened.  To add another element to the story, the beaches here are pretty white-washed, and this happened to be the only black family out in that area which sort of added to the awkwardness of the moment.  I tried cheering him up, "are you okay buddy? you''re a pretty tough guy, that was a big hit!  Sorry, etc..."  I apologized profusely to the parents, but nothing is more terrifying than looking into a mother''s eyes after you just trampled over her son.  She coldly said, "Just be more careful next time." and moves her family away from us.  I sat out for the rest of the beach activities that day.  Partly because I felt terrible about that little boy, but mostly because I thought he may have broken my shins.  Kid was made of bricks!


      TL;DR Played frisbee at the beach, punted a kid, his mom is probably still thinking of ways to murder me.'

      The user is a young adult, initially in their early twenties and progressing into their late twenties over the course of the blog posts, who has recently graduated from one of the nation''s best universities without any college debt, thanks to a trust fund that matures with approximately $90,000. As they navigate their financial independence, they seek advice on managing their trust fund, considering options such as setting aside a portion for travel and making small investments, while also valuing education and contemplating further studies, including an intensive program and potential graduate school. Having started their career, they earn around $30,000 in tax-less paychecks and later face real-world financial challenges, including managing tax payments, credit card debt, and real estate taxes on a house they own, for which they consider taking a personal loan or cash advance to cover immediate expenses. Outside of financial concerns, the user enjoys staying active, preferring a
      workout routine that includes cardio and weightlifting, and values experiences, such as traveling to places like Tulum, where they seek recommendations for adventurous activities. They are also an avid reader, interested in understanding complex concepts like chaos theory as described in books like "Jurassic Park." In their personal life, the user has been in a long-term relationship, navigating the complexities of commitment, love, and the decision to propose, having overcome initial challenges such as infidelity and currently weighing the pros and cons of marriage while pursuing graduate studies.

      Post 1:

      People who have had long-time SO''s, how do you know to keep a relationship going?


      I have been dating the same girl for about 4 and a half years, the first 2 years long distance. We have moved in together recently and everything is okay, not bad, not great, just okay. We have cheated on each other early on and have forgiven each other and are often together all the time. I feel like she has committed to me for the long haul and if I were to propose to her she would accept. But I am trying to sort out mediocrity, I really do care about this person and enjoy being around them, often times I would say I love her. I think because we are always around each other and we have been together for a long time, it just isn''t magical all the time and I am in no rush for marriage, kids or anything. How do I sort out whether to keep going with this person, sort of waiting until we feel old enough to go to the next step versus starting over and going through all of that? She gets so offended when I say I love you, but I just don''t know if I want to marry you, but it''s true. This
      might not make much sense but it''s sort of like, how do you know whether to take a risk for something unknown, something magical that you''ve imagined existed before, for a potential heartbreak? Are there different levels of love and is that okay?

      Post 2:

      Any advice for an adventurous vacation in Tulum?


      I am staying at MangleX eco-friendly bed and breakfast in Tulum. I am planning on renting a bike, but would like more information from people who have traveled there before on transportation. I am planning on taking a taxi or shuttle from the airport. I am curious about transportation, food suggestions (restaurants, bars, etc.), snorkeling, ziplining/jungle, basically any recommendations from people who have been there-not looking to just lay on the beach all day.

      Post 3:

      Just read Jurassic Park, can anyone elaborate further on chaos theory, and in particular how it is described in the book?


      I feel like I understood the general ideas but that I lost some of its meaning because I don''t have a deeper knowledge of it. That understanding the theory better might have made it seem more impactful to the story, in particular how the stages of it developed relative to the park. I''d love to hear anyone''s take on it, because I feel like it became less important as the book ended.

      US "EE" Savings Bonds


      This Christmas I received savings bonds that have been given to me through the past 20 years. The savings bonds are "series EE" and interest has been accruing with them since the date that I have received them on. Several that I have are $200-$100 that were given to me in 1995. My dad said something like I could put them in my savings account and retain an interest rate on them which is like 1.34% or something. Seeing how these bonds haven''t expired on their interest dates should I just hold on to them or put them in my savings account? Anyone have any idea on what would be the best thing to do with this money? Also for reference I have 1-$200, 10-$100, 50-$50, how much money could I potentially have if most of these were given from 1995-2000?'
    question: Now you want to write a post because you're uncertain about proposing to your 4+ year girlfriend who stayed behind when you moved for grad school. After early infidelity and privacy issues, you lived together with a dog and grew close to her family, but struggle with trust and ambivalence. Though she wants to marry you, your comfortable independence clashes with fear of losing her, leaving you unsure if your functional relationship is a lifelong commitment.
    answer: 'I''m 27, in grad school, and have been dating a girl, 28, for 4+ years, she didn''t move to school with me and I am close with her family, when do you know it''s time to propose?


      I have been in this relationship for a long time, 4+ years, we have had our ups and downs and dating through the last couple years of our undergrad apart. We both cheated on each other very early on in the relationship and have always been a little strange with each other in phone/privacy concerns. But I do not think she is cheating on me at all or has since, in fact she very much has stated that she wants to marry me. We lived together for a year and got a dog before I decided to go to grad school a few states away. She didn''t move down with me because she had a job and didn''t want to move with me - to essentially watch me be busy and get a crappy part-time job. Our families have become close and I love hanging with her dad and brother, but I don''t know if I have that moment yet where I am like I need this girl to be my wife. I can''t think about breaking up with her, but I get along fine at school being independent, I could be independent and okay. It''s weird I feel fine in a
      separate environment but don''t think I could break up with her. How do you know if you should get married or if the person you are with is someone you love? How do you know that is the love you should take with you your whole life? There is so much in me that cannot see her go and loves being with her but so much in me that is okay when she is not around.'

Match the user's writing style, tone, and perspective based on their previous content. Ensure the new post is contextually relevant, coherent, and consistent with the user's voice. Write about 150 words.\n\nHere are the user's past posts:\nPost 1:\nWhy aren't there more games about other wars?\n\nSeeing as this Fall, Battlefield 5 is being fully released, it seems that theatres/scenarios (specifically WW2) have been really run the river dry.  I can't really think of too many reasons why game devs haven't looked into other scenarios that either have only been glossed over or not even looked into at all.  I'm thinking maybe Korean War, Vietnam War (there's been some here actually), Yugoslavian conflicts, (I know it's a bit of a stretch but) Falklands War, and conflicts in Africa (just look at the wikipedia page - there's been so many that next to nobody's heard\
      \ about).  For all I care, DICE can just throw me and 31 other people into a small desert town and say it's \"somewhere in Africa\" and I would be happy because it's something new.  I know I may be alone in this but just think about how much stuff there is that nobody's even heard about.  \nBelow are a few conflicts that I don't think have ever been portrayed in a first-person shooter ever?\n    - Chinese Civil War (13 years total, resulted in 8 million casualties)\n    - Second Sino - Japanese War (8 years, resulted in 20-22 million casualties)\n    - Korean War\n    - Any African Civil War (The list is unfortunately very long)\n    - Honestly what about Somalian pirates that have to try and board an outnumbered but better equipped UN ship\n\nBasically my main point is, why no attention given to other conflicts?\nPost 2:\nTIFU by destroying my watch\n\nSo today, I  (15M) got bored, went outside, and proceeded to test how strong my watch (Casio Men's GWM5610-1 G-Shock Solar Watch)\
      \ really was. Basically, I threw it at a brick wall, and it hit the interface (therefore cracking the inner screen) therefore making my watch useless.  May also be useful to know that my parents got it for me in February or so (and warranty says that it doesn't comply if the problem was caused by \"improper, rough or careless treatment\"  how should I tell my parents? Solution?\nPost 3:\nHow realistic was the ambush scene from Forrest Gump?\n\nIn the Forrest Gump Vietnam War Ambush Scene, we see what looks like no more than 20 or so soldiers get ambushed by what appears to be an outnumbering force in a treeline ahead. My question is: how common was it to see a small patrol of soldiers getting pounced upon by NVA forces?  I understand that Forrest Gump is not supposed to emulate complete reality, but I was just curious.\nPost 4:\nHow similar was training between nations (specifically during WWII)?\n\nI was just thinking about how many training scenes there are in movies, namely Band\
      \ of Brothers, Full Metal Jacket (just the ones I could think of).  How much or less extensive was training in other nations?  I understand that training time heavily decreased towards the end of the war but around German remilitarization to 1941ish, how much more extensive was training compared to Soviet, US, British, French, Low Countries, or even Polish.  By extensive I mean approximate amount of weeks (or months) spent before or after the realization that war was imminent, as well as military exercises performed.  That's all I can really think of now, feel free to correct any assumptions I made - I'm here to learn.\n\nThanks!"
    question: Now you want to write a post to explore WWI combat beyond trench warfare, questioning post-breakthrough tactics like urban fights or rapid defensive digging. You note early cavalry use but later attrition, seeking clarity on invasion-style engagements akin to WW2, hoping to untangle your confusing queries.
    answer: 'Other engagements during WW1?


      I''m sure many people are well aware of WWI''s infamous trench warfare and its brutality, however, I was wondering about what other types of engagements took place.  For example, if part of a frontline is broken, the engagements that took place shortly after would most likely not be taking place in trenches as the defenders would not yet be dug in.  Would this post-breakthrough combat just be like city fights, or would soldiers be ordered to dig into natural points of an advantage as quickly as they could?  After some quick research, it appears that there were some cavalry engagements early on in the War, but past early on in the war, it appears to be mostly wars of attrition.  I guess what I''m trying to ask is, what type of combat took place during invasions (similar to WW2?).  I hope this question isn''t too confusing, thanks!'

They have a strong appreciation for authors like Neil Gaiman, whose quirky and creative storytelling resonates with them, although they are not immune to critiquing his work, as seen in their re-reading of Neverwhere.

Their reading tastes are varied, and they enjoy exploring different narrative styles, including limited third person and deep POV, depending on the story being told.

I wasn't a big fan of Norse Mythology when I first picked it up, but as I kept reading it I realized it was in fact, a really good book.\n\nAs far as other authors go, I, unfortunately, haven't been reading for a while and I don't have a big list I can provide of consistent authors I've been reading. However, I wanted to know what other people thought as I am interested in hearing what causes them to dislike their favorite (or one of their favorite) authors' books.   \nWas it a writing style? A poor ending? Boring characters? Too predictable?   \nDo you think the book itself was especially bad, or were your expectations high because you're a fan of the author?\nPost 2:\nIf you could re-write a book, which one would you?\n\nIs there any book you thought had such potential but it just didn't follow through?\n\nThere are a lot of books that let me down but I wonder what the author was thinking at that time that made them want to go the route they did.   \nI wonder how\
      \ much of these ideas are the authors or the publishing company. \n\nI know I would have liked for a lot of Stephen King's books to end differently but he just has bad endings I find. I don't know if I'd want to (or could possibly) re-write the book.\nPost 3:\nClose 3rd POV or deep POV. Which do you prefer?\n\n**Limited third person** limits the narrator voice to one character’s experience (thoughts) at a time and usually with a very limited cast of characters. The reader gets one character’s point of view (at a time), but the story is told by the author. Limited third has varied flexibility in how strictly the author limits themselves.\n\nVS\n\n**In Deep POV,** you’re writing AS the character instead of about them. The reader experiences the story as the character experiences the story to create an immersive effect.\n\nI like both. I feel like they depend on the story I'm reading but on occasion, deep POV can seem more YA to me.\n\nAny thoughts on this?\nPost 4:\nWhy do so many people\
      \ think Dan Brown books are bad?\n\nTo start, I'm actually trying to make this a learning experience for me.\n\nI'm a huge movie critic and only can name a few which I think are extremely well done.\n\nAs far as books, I'm not as big a reader, but I did read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code and I really enjoyed them. \n\nWhat is it about Dan Brown that people dislike so much?   \nI think the book served as an excellent suspense novel. Not every book will have beautiful prose and amazing character development. (If I remember correctly, the protagonist of most of Dan Brown's books reoccurs, so his growth wouldn't be seen in just one book, nor is it the focus of that one book)\n\nAnd as a quick disclaimer, I read the books a long time ago, and don't remember them word for word. I'm not defending him as a good author, I'm just trying to figure out what makes an author good. Especially when the point of the book isn't going to always check off a bunch of boxes (Prose, development,\
      \ strong lead...)\n\nThank you anyone who can provide some insight!"
    question: Now you want to write a post expressing your admiration for Neil Gaiman’s quirky, creative storytelling, especially in graphic novels, while critiquing the repetitive physical descriptions in *Neverwhere* that distract you during your re-read, even as you remain an enthusiastic fan of his work.
    answer: 'What are your thoughts on Neil Gaiman?


      Personally, I love his stories. I think he writes really quirky and creatively. I especially love his graphic novels.


      I just picked back up Neverwhere, where I bought it years ago and never finished. As I''m re-reading it I''m noticing a lot of "He had long hair" "she wore this" "He did that" "She said this"


      Line after line and it''s irking me a bit.

      Question about buying a second property, second mortgage etc


      Hi All,


      I wanted some advice on buying a second property and renting out my existing one.


      I have a mortgage on my current house with an interest rate of 2.5% 30 year fixed and the monthly payment is 2k. I spoke to a few rental property management companies and they estimated the rent I could get for it is around 4k a month.


      After doing some reading, I thought I had to convert my existing mortgage into a rental property mortgage so I was going to do a cash out refi and convert to investment loan, pull some cash out and then buy a new home to move into. I called my lender and the loan officer explained to me that I definitely do not have to convert the mortgage and it would be crazy to do that given the current rates.


      First question: Is what he saying true? I thought I had to convert the mortgage to a property investment loan but seems like I got that wrong.


      If what he is saying is true I need to find 50k from somewhere else for a down payment, I have around 70k saved up, next house will be around 500k - 600k and want to put down 20% down on it.


      Second question: he mentioned I should try a home equity loan but does anyone else have any other ideas? another idea is to pull it from my 401k and pay it back but I just wanted to run it by everyone here first to get your advice?


      I make 200k a year and my FICO score is around 815 right now, DTI is probably pretty low since I have a 2k mortgage payment and a 600 car payment but that''s it.


      Any help and advice is appreciated!

      Mortgage company over paid my taxes and raising my mortgage payment by $1,000


      Hi All,


      My mortgage company over paid on my taxes back in November 2022, they sent my county $6,800 which was way too much and then increased my mortgage payment by $1,000 to make up the difference. I got the correct property tax bill from the county mailed to me for around $3,600 and I then emailed a copy over to the mortgage company back on December 10th 2022.


      I spoke to about 6 different people over there between 12/10 and now, they explained that they''ve received the bill for $3,600 from me and will perform escrow analysis and readjust, I was told to hold off on paying my January mortgage payment until everything had been readjusted. I have up to January 16th (this coming Monday) to make a payment without there being a negative affect on me.


      I checked today and my account still hasn''t been updated to reflect the correct property tax amount and my mortgage payment is still inflated by $1,000. I called them up and they told me that there''s nothing they can do until they''ve received the over payment amount back from the county and advised that I pay the amount due by 1/16, they told me to check back with them and once they receive the over payment they will do the escrow analysis again and send me money back if that was the outcome of the analysis.


      I feel like I''m stuck between a rock and a hard place, is there anything I can do about this situation?


      This error was between the county and my lender, it had nothing to do with me and now I have to pay an extra $1,000 towards my mortgage payment every month. I even received the correct bill myself, I let them know and sent it over to them a month ago so I feel like I''ve done everything I was supposed to do as a customer but I''m still getting shafted. On top of that I doubt they will reimburse me for the over payment and just lower my overall mortgage payment throughout the year.


      Why should I have to pay an extra $1,000 on top of my mortgage payment because of a mistake made by my lender/county? Is there anything at all I can do? Thankfully I can afford to do that but what if I couldn''t?


      I''m really frustrated with this whole situation so any and all advice is appreciated.


      Thanks!

      Long term vs short term loan for a boat


      Hi All,


      I wanted to get some advice for long term vs short term loans for a boat, lets say sticker price is $30,000.


      Now I know the best option is to pay cash up front but I''m more looking for help in terms of justifying my way of thinking. So lets say I plan to own a boat for the rest of my life and I aim to buy a used new boat and trade it in every four years. Because I''m planning to own for a long time and trade in every four years I should just be focused on monthly payment right? and not so much how much interest I''ll be paying because I''m always going to have a monthly payment?


      So now comes the obstacle I''m trying to get my head around. What are the differences in my situation of a short vs long term loan if I plan to trade in every four years? I''ll pay a higher interest rate and more interest in that four years for a longer loan term but I''m trying to understand how that would affect me when it comes time to trade in every four years vs a short term loan? The only thing I can think of is that for a shorter loan I''ll pay more to my principal so when it comes time to trade in I''ll have more equity in the boat. Does this matter if I''m going to be having a monthly payment on a boat for a long time since I''ll be trading in every four years?


      I hope I got my point across and I guess you could argue the same with cars or any loan for a thing that you intend to have for a long time and trade in every x amount of years.


      Any and all help / advice is much appreciated and if I''ve confused the hell out of you, I apologize :)


      Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. So what I struggle with when it comes to the majority of advice is that life and my time is priceless. I could save for a year or two and pay in cash or experience being out on a boat and that life tomorrow. None of us know where we''ll be in a year or two myself included. With that said there is definitely a healthy balance in terms of paying cash up front for things and financing "toys". I would happily pay 2k in interest to enjoy boating for the next two years starting tomorrow if that makes sense?


      For anyone in the same "boat" as me or is just interested in different opinions have a read of this thread, it''s a great read with a ton of different points of view'
    question: Now you want to write a post because you’re confused about calculating 401k contributions with bi-monthly paychecks split between base and bonus, making fixed allocations tricky. You question if your employer’s $5k annual match is low and seek advice, given your $140k base and $60k yearly bonus. You later realize you overcomplicated it and should base contributions on total annual salary.
    answer: '401k contribution help


      Hi All,


      I just started with a new job and I''m trying to figure out what % of my paycheck I should pay towards my 401k. The issue I''m running into is that I get paid twice a month, mid month paycheck will be my base salary and then end of month will be base salary plus bonus which means I can''t just divide the max 401k contribution by 24 pay cycles.


      Any ideas on what I can do?


      Also, as a side note my employer''s contribution limit each year is 5k, is that really low or is it just me?


      Any help on the best approach would be appreciated. For general numbers assume I get 140k base salary and 60k bonus spread out over the year, bonus being paid out only in the last paycheck each month.


      Thanks!


      Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice, seems like I was over thinking it as per usual. Focusing on % of total yearly salary and that''s what my contribution should be, got it!'

      Post 1:

      If educated, working women are filing multiple false rape cases to extort money so brazenly, the law must be failing somewhere to punish such false accusers giving them confidence


      If we want rapists to be hanged, shouldn''t all such false accusers be given the strongest punishment?'
    question: Now you want to write a post clarifying you don’t assume every man accused by a woman is innocent, nor advocate for every man who approaches you. You’ve been blunt when sensing dishonesty, including when offered money to defend a famous accused individual.
    answer: I don't see every man accused by a woman as innocent. I don't help every man who comes to me to take his side or speak up for him. In fact I have been very curt in response when I smell things fishy. I remember I was offered any amount I pleased to write in favor of a famous man

    answer: I thought the mid range Zojirushi was probably a waste, but honestly, I have the same thing, I can always eat rice but it's hard to cook it in a pot. these rice cookers are 1000% worth it. it holds it at warm for a really long time. the rice doesn't over or undercook ever.

    scenario: "I want you to imitate a user in blog writing. Below is a list of previous blogs written by the user: \n   \nBlog post 1:\nEven though I felt like I was going to die, my mind kept on racing.  As I drove home from the hospital, coughing and wheezing and completely miserable, I caught a glimpse of the tiny blue harbor lights on my left.  I sped down the freeway, rolling down the window to take in the sea air.  I breathed in, as deep as possible in my current condition, the smell and the texture of the air made it’s way to my center.  I settled back in the car, turned the radio up, let the wind blow through my hair and took it all in.  I felt damn good for someone who is “6-inches away from having pneumonia.”  The money, or substantial lack thereof, is of course a problem.  As soon as I’m a few more steps away from death warmed over, it’s solvable.  True, I have no furniture still.  Such is the case with many long distance moves.  True, I am living my ever challenging life on\
      \ my own.  But that’s the bonus.  Knowing that I am doing it on my own…that I can do it on my own.  In spite of the numerous and considerable challenges I’ve faced in the last four years, I did it.  I made it.  I left Denver.  I’m back in San Diego and starting over.  In spite of the fact that my family is toxic and ridiculous and unsupportive.  In spite of my ability to attract toxic energy-sucking people into my life who don’t know the concept of give and take.  In spite of my family’s ability to beat me down and get me to forget all the things I’ve accomplished or overcome in my life….college, moving across country at 18 alone, serious illness, permanent injury, rape, working since I was 13, graduating high school early, a devastating earthquake, moving across country again alone, death of many friends and family.  How is it that we are so eager to believe the bad things people say about us?  My dear sweet friend, Danny, said something profound to me recently.  He said, if there\
      \ were 50 cable channels all devoted to you, 48 positive and 2 negative, which ones would you watch?  Sad to say, I knew I watch them all but I would focus on the 2 negative ones.  Why IS that?  We convince ourselves that these people who rarely, if ever, take risks know better than we do.  That their word is gospel.  They don’t know me.  They don’t know the way I live my life every day.  They don’t know that I’m the person in the grocery store that puts something back on the shelf after 50 people walked by.  They don’t know that I have rescued more animals than I can remember and placed them in good homes.  They don’t know that I write letters and lobby congress for better animal rights legislation.  They don’t know that even with a blinding migraine I talk to my best friend about whether or not she wants to get a divorce.  They don’t know that after thinking an offhand comment I made to a store clerk hurt a stranger’s feelings that I chased him down an outside mall in the snow to\
      \ apologize.  They don’t know 100 other things I do that are good.  It’s not that they don’t ever see me or talk to me, but they don’t SEE.  They don’t pay attention.  They never have.  Yet they have the audacity to criticize me and I let it hurt me.  When someone does comment on my integrity or intellect or good character, I can always find a way to not let it count….not let it in.  They don’t know me well enough or they haven’t seen the other side of me.  How asinine is that?  The thing is, that maybe because I can be my true self with them…because they have no preconceived notion of me….that just maybe they DO see me.  The real me.  I wonder how many times I will have to have this conversation with myself for it to stick?  So my family thinks I’ve flipped my gidget.  They don’t know that that’s where the beauty is.  I’m a vegetarian Buddhist with a law degree and Irish catholic roots .  They are fundamentalist Christians, good ole’ fashion Christians, Catholics and one Jew.  Having\
      \ 6 parents does at least provide for variety.  They all took the “should” road.  You know…you “should” go to college and get married.  I have no issue with that if it’s a choice, but they all fell into what was expected of them.  Except for my Mom.  She fucked everybody up and got pregnant out of wedlock.  The “good” girl.  But then immediately proceeded along the “should” road again.  I have no problems with the way they live their lives except when it comes to judging how I live mine.  I want to LIVE it and stumble through and figure it out.  I may have a lawyer’s mind, but I have an artist’s heart.  The ever pounding, bleeding, bruised heart that feels, thinks, and emotes too much.  Or should I say “too” much.  Part of the juicy part of life is the hard part.  The pain feeds my soul and heart and life experience, thereby feeding my words, as much as the happy parts.  I’m sure I’m some kind of anomaly to them.  And you know, that’s okay.  I’m perfectly happy being unpredictable,\
      \ that way people have to take the time to get to know me to figure me out.    True, it’s not perfect.  The uncertainty makes me sick.  Keeps me up at night.  Maybe that’s what drives me.  What a sick conundrum is this?  The very thing that rips me up is also my passion.  At this point, I realized I have reasoned myself in circles.  I just need to focus on the energy pounding inside me.  The energy and vibe of this city just surrounds me.  The sound of the ocean.  The smell of the water.  That tiny center in me that stays still and certain inside the storm.  The sound of my fingers on the keyboard.  It’s all my grounding force.    I can sleep on that.\n\nBlog post 2:\nQuote of the day:  Low carb orange juice?  Give me a fucking break!   Just when I’ve found a happy place to swim around in and have a martini, BLAM….the universe slaps a fucking post-it note on my forehead that says, “Not so fast sparky!”  After endless hours of coughing and coughing….too many powdered sugar doughnuts…no\
      \ sleep… and nightmares of living in my car with the cats and a guy named Speedy, I realize, here I am again.  Why is it that we must constantly readjust our center?  Refocus?  Why is everything so mushy?  By this profound term I mean, not solid…in flux…moving?  Buddhist philosophy is based on the theory of impermanence, that everything in the universe is connected and everything is changing.  Damn, that pisses me off.  Buddhist philosophy has helped me refocus my life and find meaning in my pain.  It’s made me understand suffering and it’s purpose.  But, seriously, I’d like to get to a point where things are rolling along smoothly and stay there for 5 bloody minutes.  It’s like the hard the bad the mean the ugly has staying power.  The floaty the swimmy the happy the peaceful can’t be pinned down.  When things are dark and really bad, you have to ask for help.  You have to.  I mean, what is this shit that “oh he never complains!” or “I’d starve before asking for anything.”  I understand\
      \ pride and independence.  But being a martyr does not help anyone be well rounded and complete.  Both sides are needed.  I am surrounded by the people that love to beat me down when things are dark.  As if I intentionally created the storm.  We are all human, and I really don’t believe in mistakes.  We do things unconsciously and have to examine why.  Things that seems like mistakes are really life lessons.  Well, not the, “fuck, I missed my exit” kind of mistakes.  At least not usually.  That hurts my head to think about, so I’ll move on.  I can’t make them all happy, and I must stop trying.  It’s a fact that they simply will not understand me, and that has to be okay.  In fact, it may be true that a rare few may understand me….after all I am a complicated, complex, sometimes high-maintenance, arteest who is often unpredictable.  I’m moody and have been through a hell of a lot for any one life time.  This stops people from getting through, I guess.  It certainly wouldn’t hurt me\
      \ to learn how to keep that from showing up as all of me…the “real” me.    I’m finally realizing that it’s not about people liking me.  That’s not where it’s at.  I know that seems obvious, but I’m just now getting it.  I want people to like me and to be a good person, a good friend.  I want to learn how to be a better person, always.  It’s so important to me.  But, what I didn’t realize was that I was working so hard at getting approval and validation that I was sacrificing myself…my self esteem…the very things I was trying to obtain and make solid in the first place.  I have to be sensitive to other people’s feelings and polite.  It’s important to try not to impose on people and consider the other person’s position.  But at the end of the day I have to take care of me.  I have to do what I need to do to get the bills paid, food on the table, and all of my personal needs met.  How ridiculous is it to say that I’m just now figuring out what the phrase “it’s MY life” is all about? \
      \  I don’t have anyone to apologize to when I try and fail.  My choices and risks are mine, I own them no matter the outcome.  That’s the first brick I need to build a new life.  A new life here by the sea with the energy, my words, my new fresh pink soul, and the keys to my own destiny firmly (okay, sometimes shakily) in my grip.  Fuck that post-it note.  Sparky is here to stay.\n\nBlog post 3:\nQuote of the day: Caffeine is the blood of life. I’m determined to post before midnight from now on so that I can not be confused by what the hell day I actually posted anymore. It’s a small goal. It’s all about the little things. Forced myself to stay in bed….just stay there. No tv, no computer, no reading or writing. Just sleep. I haven’t slept much since I got sick, and I guess with things being as they are the stressmonster didn’t allow a l whole lot of sleep before then. I must get better so I can (a) get one of those things that people have….you know, a place they go every day and they\
      \ are given money for tasks? (b) send out queries (c) get the fuck out of my jammies, outta this house for a destination other than the hospital or pharmacy, and down to the beach. I finally couldn’t take it anymore and bounced out of bed (okay, stumbled sort of Sanford style) and turned to my trusty laptop to relieve me of all the noise in my head. The words just bouncing around and demanding to be free. Persistent little fuckers they are, no? “Take me to paper now or lose me forever!” they shout. Other little persistent elements of the day were Petie and Scrapper, my two fuzzikids. Scrapper, the diva and older one, loves to play with Petie, the baby, for exactly a minute and a half. After that she turns into satan. He gets confused and tried to play anyway (he’s a little simple, but I love him for that)….then he gets a little pissed off at her drama and taunts her….then mommy must get in to the picture. So there you find me, in bed, coughing disheveled and grumpy squirting a water\
      \ pistol aimlessness around the room with still-closed eyes trying to find the satan noises and stop the madness. They laugh at me and run in the living room where I cannot reach. Once this game becomes old, they start in with the in depth complicated procedure of trying to get me out of bed. Scrapper will run up, get in my face…nose to nose….lick my nose and meow. Oh, cute girl . Then, she runs away. THEN she come back. Then, she runs away. THEN, she comes back. Etcetera ad nauseaum. Meanwhile, Petie is playing Army Ranger with my feet and strategizing the best way to invade my toes. Then, there’s the sounds. You know the ones….in the other room…the creaking sounds of a cat on top of something that’s about to fall in, topple over, or break? Or the ones where you know they’ve gotten into the garbage or stuck in a drawer. (Petie thinks it’s funny to squish his big self into a skinny long bathroom drawer, so as he can sit behind it, and watch mommy turn purple.) They really are outlandishly\
      \ clever and terribly good at this game. I’m up already dammit. And you know what happened? The minute I got up? They went to SLEEP! Look at me posting during actual daylight! Wahoo! I deserve a cookie. Anyone got a cookie?\n\nBlog post 4:\nThe best is a matter of standards - and I set my own standards.  I inherit nothing.  I stand at the end of no tradition.  I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one. - unknown    Yes, that is totally irrelevant.  I didn’t know what else to say.  Feeling a bit better today.  Coughing so hard I pulled a muscle in my NECK if you can believe that.  Got laundry done, which is a good thing.  Jammies and sheets and pillowcases all downy soft and smelling good.  And, of course, Petie has plopped his little furry self right down in the middle of them.  Now, if we could just throw me in the washing machine.  I need to be washed and soft and smelling good.  Any one got a sponge?  I’ve realized how much I need to get out of the house.  There was this big\
      \ spider in my light fixture in the kitchen.  I could see its little creepy silhouette above me in the plastic fixture.  Every time I went in the kitchen I checked to see if he was there.   My neighbor across the courtyard must have watched me through my balcony door looking up in the kitchen constantly and said…dayam, what’s the crazy girl doing now?  What freaked me out was when I went in there and he was GONE.  I hate those fucking things.  Hate them.   My Mom says, harm no living thing…except spiders and roaches and icky bugs we don’t know!  Bad Buddhist.  On a serious note, I love that quote above.  I set my own standards.  I stand at the end of no tradition.  I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one.  Brilliant.  My own tradition of taking risks, making mistakes, following my instincts and my heart.  My own tradition of being okay with bucking “tradition” and finding my own way.  Going against the grain.  I guess I probably don’t have to talk about this with anyone on the\
      \ BN.  A bunch of nonconformists we are.  Excellent.    Yes, well, I’m about as funny or inspirational as a bottle of glue.  So, off I go to fold my laundry.\n\nBlog post 5:\nI'm too blue and too angry and too distracted and too overwhelmed and too lonely.... behind...broke...hungry...sick...sad...irritated....frustrated...discouraged...pensive...and abandoned to write much today.  At least not in daylight hours.  Okay, daylight hours have passed, but it's not hardcore vampire time yet.  Do you ever feel like no matter what you do, you will never manage to make the life you want?  Become the person you want to be?  Or, no matter what you do or say...don't do or don't say...you will never be able to make 'loved ones'...or even new people...see you for who you are?  What you have done in life, faced, accomplished, etc....instead of what you haven't?  Do you ever feel like it will never change?  You will never be happy?  Never feel loved?  That maybe you are not destined to be happy or\

Lights up the whole world.” –  unknown    Haven’t written in a while.  Been caught up in the day to day.  Then I remember that the day to day is sometimes the most fascinating things we have to share with each other.  Went to the beach yesterday.  It’s amazing how the smallest things, even the near nothings, can make for the most brilliant day.  Winter here brings hazy sunshine and clouds almost every morning.  The haze spreads up from the beach, up over the bay and the harbor, until blue gray fingers of clouds turn into cloudless blue skies spread over miles of palm trees.  The smell of the water fills the air everywhere, even in the city.  You can feel it on your skin.  My hair always has this wild just-got-out-of-bed look with the perfect amount of curl.  Every morning, I open my eyes and am grateful\
      \ that I’m here.  That I made it back to the city of my spirit.  Even when things are bad, it soothes me.  Life is in the little things.  That is said a lot, but I think we don’t really appreciate that truth enough.  Waking up on soft, white cotton sheets, with the breeze coming over the harbor into my window.  Little black kitty curled at my side.  My boy Petie.  Little long haired tabby princess curled on the floor, for some reason believing my Nike’s to be an immensely comfortable place to sleep.  My girl Scrapper.  The details of the morning bring comfort and solace.  Hot, milky Irish tea.   Fresh grapes and bananas.  Joss Stone, Etta James, Diana Krall or maybe even a little Metallica, depending on my mood.  Super cold, sweet and tart pomegranate/cherry juice.  My pink tongue it leaves behind.  The beautiful Spanish boy next door playing classical guitar.     Soft jammies, the paper, CNN on in the background.  The trick is to focus on the details that help evolve your positive\
      \ disposition, not the fact that AOL has now charged my account twice for an account I never had thereby tying up money in my bank account….money which is monumentally scarce.  Those details tend to take over and can shift our focus from what we want to what we don’t.  I believe when you focus on avoiding what you don’t want, your energy is there so much that you create what you don’t want.  So, I rub Petie’s belly, schedule job interviews, make the most amazing ramen noodles with fresh veggies, spring onions, mushrooms…and remember that the best stories come from struggle.\n\nBlog post 7:\n“It’s never to late to be what you would have been.” –  George Eliot     Kettle screams out.  Steamy hot water swirls the tea around in the cup.  Peppermint, Spearmint, Chamomile all rise up to greet me.  I watch the honey melt off of my spoon into my cup.  I sit down in my big purple chair to contemplate the evening holding the big cobalt blue mug between my open hands, holding tight to warm my\
      \ fingers.  As I sip the tea, the warm washes through me.  Like liquid solace.  Have you ever been walking through your life, doing the day to day or working, whatever…and this voice whispers something to you?  Deep inside.  In your soul.  Your spirit.  Maybe an instinct, maybe the universe giving you a clue.  Something so real and basic, you know it’s true, but you don’t acknowledge it out loud, or even to yourself for too long, because it’s best not to speak it.  It’s best to just create it.  Make it happen.  The Great Spirit says, when the voice tells you what is true, only whisper it on the wind.  Those who are jealous or unsettled will want to tear you down.  Once you hear that voice of opposition, you might let it drown out your own voice.  You can make it more powerful…make it louder…until it you let it tear you down and destroy your vision.  That happens to me a lot, that whisper.  I think it always has, but I think I’m just now starting to hear it.  Thank the goddess for that\
      \ one.  Tonight, I was making my tea….warm and safe at home…hopeful about the direction I’m taking.  I was writing, and chatting with a friend online.  The voice came to me, “This is your life.”  It’s that simple.  This feeling, this direction, this activity….that is my life, where it is going, how I will make it.  I can’t explain that in more depth for the simple reason that it’s intangible, but my spirit recognizes the statement and agrees.  I sip my tea and let the warmth of it and these thoughts fill me up.  I lean back in the chair and let Sweetback take me away.  The music dances over my skin, flows through me, surrounds me like a blanket and lifts me up to a place where it all seems to be coming together.  I narrate my life everyday.  As I walk through the world, I write it in my head.  What I see, what I smell, what I’m thinking.  All the tangibles and the intangibles.  When the music comes, it needs to be my soundtrack.  It always calls to me like a friend, providing the audio\
      \ component to my experience.  I stood there tonight, looking over the vast ocean in its inky blue blackness.... fluorescent white foamy caps breaking and splaying over the rocks and the sand.  The sound of the ocean beating against the cliff and rocks was so loud, I couldn’t hear anything else even though I was high above.  I watched the sea water slam into the cove, meander inside to the utter darkness and flow somewhat slowly out the other side, only to be sucked in and pulled back out by the tide.  It seemed to be in a huge hurry to go nowhere.  At times I relate to that.  The haze from the ocean’s misty kisses covered all the windows and cars and air everywhere.  It was as if I looked at the scene through nylon, like they shoot the beautiful actresses through when they want them to be unbearably beautiful and glamorous.  The night was just chilly enough for a light jacket, but not too chilly that wandering up and down the coast wasn’t pleasurable.  The night breeze lifted the\
      \ moist ocean air over me and through my hair.  I breathed deeply, taking it in, as if I could breathe in the ocean.  It soothes me.  Has conversations with my soul.  My spirit.  I don’t know how, but this brings me center.    My Mom joins me this night.  Eileen and my biological father are in visiting this weekend. I have 3 sets of parents (therefore 3 moms), so for simplicity’s sake we will use her name, Eileen.  She tells me that walking on the beach that day, she found a sandollar.  You don’t find sandollars or shells much on pacific coast beaches.  She said it was a sign.  A sign that this weekend would go smoothly and we would be a family and have a peaceful weekend.  As I look away from the water breaking on the rocks below, I realize she has tears in her eyes.  I have had some issues that have seemed to be beyond resolve with my father and Eileen.  I still don’t know if they are resolvable.  In this magic moment standing next to the water, it seems we may have found some common\
      \ ground.  I explain to her that it hurts me when they say what they say without proper information.  When they don’t realize how hard I work, how much I’ve accomplished.  When they don’t see me, how I really am.  She seems to understand in her facial expressions and gestures, that maybe there is a gap here.  That maybe they don’t really have all the facts.  That maybe even if they did, it’s not their place to judge a situation they have no familiarity with.  She tells me she just wants to be a family….good, bad, and indifferent.  I smile at that.    We walk back up the many steps to the restaurant where we proceed to have a fabulous dinner of seared ahi, rice noodles, spring rolls, shrimp and martinis.  My father proceeds to lighten up the mood by stealing, by hand, a handful of my rice noodles and shove them in his mouth.  This is a nice restaurant.  I am my father’s daughter in some ways.  I throw more noodles at him.  I sip my apple martini under the toasty heat lamps surrounding\
      \ us on the patio above the ocean.  We joke about my brother and Eileen flirts with the waiter.  We talk through the night about what we will do with the rest of their time here.  After I’ve seen them back to their hotel, I drive away home.  The night is cooler now, but the window is down so I can surround myself with that cool, moist night air.  I chuckle as I think…we should find sandollars more often."

    answer: There is a real magic to enthusiasm.  It spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment. -  Norman Vincent Peale    The new job at, we’ll just call it Yellow, has provided an endless flow of post-it notes and scribbles in my journal for writing later.  Problem is, getting up at 5:00 a.m. is not in my natural repertoire, neither is falling asleep at 10:00, so I’ve been in a constant state of tired juggling the necessities of my life after work.  I’ve been saying this a lot, but this, like everything, is an adjustment.  The schedule and my tendency to put too require too much of myself in too small of a period of time, have left me sick and dealing with brain fatigue from the brain injury. I have been doing really well with scheduling and planning, and trying to expect less from myself.  But, I still am running around at 10:00 trying to finish up the day instead of going to sleep.  It’s definitely progress though.  House and car are clean.  Bills are handled (as much
      as they can be for right now).  Laundry’s done.  Still working on incorporating other things into my day and get into a rhythm I’m happy with.  I have to make sure to keep writing time and query time a priority.  After all, that’s the mission and this job is just a way to fund the mission.  Progress is slow, but it’s progress.  Being at Yellow can be desperately boring, but provides endless character study.  It’s rich with characters that is.  I sit there, 7:30 in the morning trying to get into the rhythm of the day.  House music pumps through my headphones and into my veins supplying much needed energy.  I don’t listen to house that much, but here I need it to tune out all the chatter around me as well as the chatter in my head.  I need the beat.  The groove.  I swig Pepsi like it’s beer trying to fill up on caffeine and sugar.   Under my breath I curse the sales rep with the staple fetish that makes my review of the contract much more difficult and time consuming.  Some of the characters
      are here already.  One of my favorite is L.  She dresses completely differently every day, like each day a different personality was in charge.  This day she’s wearing a bright t-shirt under overalls, and fuzzy blue/pink/green slippers.  Yes, slippers.  This is not uncommon.  One girl wears her Curious George slippers quite often, and another girl was in pajama bottoms.  L’s hair is short, just below the ears, but it’s big.  The back is cut really short in layers up the back of her head.  She plays with it a lot, so it looks like she just woke up.  She shuffles by with growly-face and mutters to herself.  We fell about.  Periodically she mutters a little louder about something or tells us, in jest, to get back to work.  I can’t look at her sometimes without wanting to crack up.  Every single day right before the end of her shift, she begins to panic and curse and mutter louder.  Today, she does the slipper shuffle, but the day before she did the angry girl stomp in her calf-length
      high heeled boots.  L. also is sweet and turned me onto Pablo Neruda and gives me good feedback on my work.  In my little section of four where I sit, there is J., a 6’2” black guy that apparently has tapeworm because I have to keep all food away from him or it’s gone.  There is S., who’s Hawaiian and works another full time job.  She fights with her sister a lot, and mostly shows up as innocent.  Then, something slips and I tell her she’s busted.  Finally, there is I. who is an Asian woman, older than the rest of us, and just very sweet.  I don’t know her exact background, but there is a few people here that she either knows or has befriended because they share the same ethnicity.  At lunch they each bring a couple of things and sit around and share dishes.   She gets migraines too, so occasionally you will see her with her head on her desk.  J. is very loud, all the time.  Talking to himself, doing calculations out loud, having his radio on without headphones, singing and rapping.  He
      was calculating out loud the other day, and I wrote down the numbers he was saying out loud on a contract as a new contract number.  He has a good sense of humor about it though, and I was able to tell him that I can’t work if he does his job out loud.  It changed very little.  Once day, he was singing along with Christina Aguilera, and I. was singing “Tiny Bubbles.”  I was in the middle pulling my hair out.  At lunch, J. takes a nap in his chair and snores.  When S. is away, he steals her lotion (which is very girly smelling).  He also has a 73-year-old man as a roommate.  Not live in care, they are roommates.  Where the hell do I work already?  In training, people thought I would be the clown.  I’m really pretty quiet at work.  During the long, boring training I would do things to amuse myself.  On one day in particular, none of us could make proper sentences.  I said it was a catching case of mushy peas.   Mushy peas is a dish made by Nigella Lawson, a lovely British chef who has
      a show called Nigella Bites.  It always seemed to fit my days where I couldn’t retrieve words or speak properly.  I always make a joke to alleviate my discomfort with that.  So, my trainer picked it up and now it’s common to hear in the office.  My trainer also kept calling me Pam, because I look like her friend Pam.   She couldn’t remember my name.  It became problematic when a girl I’ve become friends with at work, M. , started calling me Wynona because I look like Wynona Ryder with long hair.  Finally, to help the trainer, I took the post-it note she had with my name on it and stuck it to my forehead.  I can do this with a straight face.  There was much laugher and oh, Temple, you’re so funny…she remembered my name after that though.  I find so many of the inane details of work entertaining, I suppose that’s my salvation.  I have this staple remover with a magnetic end.  I remove a lot of staples, so I find it very entertaining to get them off my desk with that little end.  I had
      an ergonomic evaluation done, which as far as we can tell is just for show because they’ve changed nothing.  I’m not tall and my legs are supposed to be at a 90 degree angle.  This means I have a little step-stool thingy underneath my desk.  The ergonomic guy kept touching me and telling me the same things over and over.  I think I made him nervous.   He spent 5 minutes with J. who really needs to adjust his space because he’s so tall.  He said, over and over, don’t let your feet be on an island.   Meaning that I’m comfortable with my feet there so I don’t turn all the way around when I needed to.  I laugh still when I move around from my island to another spot.  I hate my job because it’s not what I feel like I should be doing.  I went to school and did all the right things so I could do what I felt I should be doing.  The only way to do it every day is to remember that it’s only temporary…to find the humor and the details that amuse me or make me think.  Having to go there every
      day makes me more motivated to find a way to stop going there, which is to let my writing take off.  It’s forced me to deal with my scheduling difficulties in new ways, and brought progress there.  It’s supporting me, barely, and giving my poor mind relief from the details of the war.  There is relief and purpose to even mundane details we all must deal with.  Our mission is to look around and find them.  It’s our most important education.  It breeds discipline (my weakness), structure, perspective, gratitude.  I look at people in my office like L. who cannot find a positive detail in her work day.  How lucky I am that I can find reasons for it, find out why it’s there and why I must honor it now…even if I hate it.  One day, I will be writing for a living and telling you about an editor that makes me want to jump out of my skin.  There will always, always be something that gets to us or that we hate.  Growth comes in embracing those things, making them yours, finding the spin.  Just
      being willing to try that brings unforeseen gifts and enrichment to our lives and spirits.

    question: "Imagine you are the author and write a new blog post of approximately 630 words on the following topic:\n\"The author reflects on their independence and self-reliance, expressing distrust of people who make promises they can't keep and a preference for solitude, while also acknowledging the complexities of human connection and the desire for genuine relationships.\".   \n \nBegin the blog with these words: \"There is a certain class of people whom i will call 'avid promisers' that inspire such a tangle of emotions\". \n   \nWrite from the first-person perspective, matching the author's style, and output only the blog post content without any additional explanations.\n\n"
    answer: There is a certain class of people whom i will call 'avid promisers' that inspire such a tangle of emotions in me. I'm pretty set on having to pay for everything that will come with the next stage of my life. NO one will buy me a car, no one will pay for college, no one will pay for the forms to become a citizen, no one will help me with my driver's liscence and no one will send me to Japan. I have to do all these things myself and while i admit, i wish it were easier, i fully accept that it isn't. This is where avid promisers really tick me. They promise to help with this or to give that, but all they're really doing is beging for worship, beging to be asked for help and to have some sort of protective claim over a person. 'Oh i helped you with this, i'm a really good guy.' What's worse is that sometimes i believe them adn fall in to the dilemma that many of us face, i call it the 'cinderella syndrome.' We all think that one day someone is going to help us, take us away from
      our burderns, ease our loads, be dependable. The key word is 'dependable.' Few people are really dependable, and when you fall prey to an avid promiser you are falling prey to the destruction of your dreams. The truth is that we must all believe that we have to do it ourselves, or atleast i have to. The moment i start to believe that there is help is the moment i risk not completing the task myself, the moment i risk taking it easy and depending. It's also why i hate waiting for someone. I always get the feeling that they'll never come for me, that i'm a lone. That's why i don't like people forgetting me. When i was a kid my mother only saw me on sundays, she would leave me the whole week in this random shack in the country somewhere to be taken care off because dad was nowhere to be found and mum had to work to support us and buy us the medicine that we needed. Every week i was left with the feeling that she would never come back, but she always came back, which is why i only really
      trust my mother to love me and remember me. I question everyone else's even my father's dedication or especially his. I'm really most comfortable when alone. I feel closer to nature or to something beyond when i'm by myself. Today i walked by myself  to the library after some rescheduling was made known to me. I mused on how beautiful the day was and how peaceful i felt, even among the horns of the cars and the engines grunting. I didn't feel stupid or foolish and i didnt feel the need to make a sarcastic comment, and i didn't have to think about wether the person next to me understood me. I yearned and desired nothing, i just walked and i was happy. The wind, the sun, and my trip to the library could not disappoint me, it wouldn't forget me, it wouldn't need to apologize and i didn't feel the need to try and let it know me so that it could maybe care about me. I didn't feel stupid because i thought it was beautiful and because i didn't fear it would take away some happyness. I like
      being alone, and yet i can't really be without people. I just wish i'd find more people who didn't make me feel so out of place, so forgettable. I think i just hate yearning for their affection.

    scenario: "I want you to imitate a user in blog writing. Below is a list of previous blogs written by the user: \n   \nBlog post 1:\nMonday mornings are usually dull n murky but sometimes they could become as good as what I had today. Guess what ??? I got an email from my good old buddy - Rizal, for short, Riz. Riz and I, share a very contagious habit of sharing ideas, analysing each other and ruthlessly yet mercifully attacking each other with words. Ruthless in the content and Merciful in language. Did u get it why is it both ruthless and merciful at the same time?   I felt overjoyed to know I was successful in getting him out of his slumber chamber but was soon bogged down by subtle, patient, simple, cool, calm and imaginative  'Tariq Sultan way of thought' as opposed to tricky and puzzling 'Shahid Husain school of Thought' of mine.  Well to know more about these schools of thoughts, keep coming to my BLOG...the Ingredients of Life !!!\n\nBlog post 2:\nLife at Aligarh Muslim University\
      \ (AMU) campus used to be great fun and of late , it has become one of my choicest memory lane.   The campus, with lots of greenery and old n new buildings, is a confluence of architecture and natural beauty. The beauty of AMU campus lies in the peace and pace. Talking about the pace, it is such that no one would be left behind. You can always catch on...no matter where you've been...  Sipping tea at the dhabas( Roadside Cafe) was a compulsory act before and after every important or unimportant activity. People riding bicycles and cycle-rickshaws seemed to be in a little (just a Little) hurry. Looking at this, the pace would automatically be set to RELAX mode.  Local people working in Delhi used to come back on weekends and found the place very soothing but the students or people living around the campus would try to rush back to Aligarh whenever they visited Delhi for any work...  The evenings used to be calm. Slowly, the energy level of resident students would rise up. By that time,\
      \ it would be around 7 pm. Obviously, the evenings would continue as long as 1 am or 2am.\n\nBlog post 3:\nLife is full of different hues and shades. In a way, life itself inspires me to live by showing its colours. Sometimes bright, sometimes not so bright and at times, the dark ones...   It inspires me by showing people much powerful, higher, stronger than me and it makes me patient and thankful when it shows stark realities like hunger, impoverishment, illness, disability and loneliness.   Therfore, i believe, Life Inspires\n\nBlog post 4:\nMr Tariq Sultan, a retired IFS Officer happens to be an alumnus of Aligarh Muslim University. He loves to stay calm and his way of explaining things and debating on various topics is very subtle. He always adopts a very practical and pragmatic approach. He uses simple words to express himself, clearly.  Once, Riz and I, were in Aligarh Club (The AMU Alumni Club) along with the great personalities like Mr. Shahid Husain and Mr. Tariq Sultan. We\
      \ had many discussions and they shared many anecdotes from their lives. All this while, Riz got the time to analyse them. Thus, were invented the 'Styles of Thoughts'.  I won't divulge about 'Shahid Husain School of thought' at this moment because it requires more time. I want to give it more attention as I am the one to identify with him, the most.\n\nBlog post 5:\nTwo years back, when Riz was leaving India, I was thinking about the nice times we had during his 2-month stay at Hyderabad. He came here to pursue his MCSE and Networking courses err...Actually...he came to have some good time with me, reminiscing the good old past on pretext of training and blah blah blah. We really had a gala time. I used to rush back from Office to a nondescript hostel room where Riz stayed. We went around the streets of Hyderabad, sat by the side of Husain Sagar, watched movies, had Irani chai at most of the Café and tried biryani at most of the popular joints. While doing all these things, we were\
      \ always in touch with our glorious past stay at AMU.  When Riz was leaving, I was getting the feeling that a chapter has been closed and now we won’t have our never-ending discussions until we meet next. And when would that “next” be? Would it really “be”? This maverick called Riz answered all my queer queries, one by one, over these two years.   When we were parting, we promised to mail each other but I felt that like all other friends or relatives, we would get busy in our lives, slowly. Emails would become smaller and soon we won’t have anything to tell or discuss but I am now forced to abandon these views. All this is because of our exceptionally long emails whenever we get engaged in an email discussion. We think for hours or a day or two and then write emails that would fill mills of pages. The debates and discussions still go on. Who says the emails should be kept short ???\n\nBlog post 6:\nBefore talking about this school of thought, let me tell you something about this great\
      \ personality. Mr Shahid Husain comes from a very noble family of Hyderabad and something that he holds in great dignity is the fact that he worked for the last crown prince of the  legendary Nizams , Prince Mukarram jah Bahadur. He had the “Power of Attorney” to act on behalf of the prince in his absence and he was much more than just being a Personal Assistant to the prince. He also claims to have had the keys of the majestic Falaqnuma Palace at Hyderabad. Presently, he holds many important posts in various Non-Profit Organizations including the post of Vice-President, Aligarh Club (AMU Alumni Association).  By now, I hope you must have figured out what all he might have seen. Yes, he has experienced great power in his hands and which is very intoxicating in its own way. He loves to give commands and anybody would take it from him, with the kind of personality he is. Tall built, polite manners, a high taste of life, command over English and Urdu languages, passion for cars, horses,\
      \ books, pens and cigarette lighters and a voice that could be very gentle and at times, could go on to become a thunder. This is what describes him very briefly. Besides, he is very good extemporary speaker. Usually, he talks using very crisp language but when in a jolly mood, you would find him citing anecdotes from his life, quoting great, renowned poets and garnishing it all with matchless humour. He is too fond of using idioms and analogies in his conversation. To sum up, he never lets his listeners get bored. Rather, he keeps them busy thinking, engaged and mesmerized.  If my description of Mr. Shahid Husain helps you get his picture, then I guess you have already arrived at the ' Shahid Husain School of Thought '. You are most welcome here. And...Ifff...You haven’t and are still thinking...then, Bon Voyage!!!...because I am still not as articulate as Mr. Shahid Husain.\n\nBlog post 7:\nWhen a man sets some goals and sets off to pursue them, he is alone. He doesn't like it so\
      \ he calls some other men to accompany him. For some distinct reasons, none can accompany him, so he is left alone. Desolate and lonely, yet with a fire to Go and a desire to Succeed, he starts off. He hasn't reached far when he hears somebody yelling, 'Hey, I am coming with you until our paths don't divert and separate us'.  Well, what would the man say? He happily agrees, for, they are just a few steps that matter.  (We all are here to walk those few steps for us and then we might cease to be, but Life never ceases. It goes on and will go on until, the Creator, decides otherwise. We must try to walk those two steps of our few steps with someone who wants us or whom we want. We can always take our own path on the crossroad where we take our separate paths to our individual goals.)  While the two were on the way, they were happy but felt there could be more. So, they called up more people to join in. They heard someone saying, 'I am already on my way and will join you guys at milestone\
      \ 'A'. Now there is hope for these guys. Hope to meet this person at milestone 'A' and they have got a short-term goal to reach milestone 'A'.  This is what Life is made of...Short and Long-term goals, Starting-off alone with hope of meeting more people, Going on even when u r alone, with hope...We must never be afraid of starting it, all alone, as looking at your desire to reach your goals, more people would want to join u. I believe, positive attitude attracts. Let's have it.  What do u say? Helloooo!!!! Anybody there? Am I all alone? So what, I hope they would soon join me...\n\nBlog post 8:\nLadies & Gentlemen, and dear friends, Good Evening to you All....(yes, its evening here in Doha, and the time here is 20:29PM, which is GMT+3). It all started a few days back, when Qais had yet another of his wake up calls , and this time, to start a blog on the public domain , his latest interest being in writing , which is quite understandable, since he's a quite capable technical writing\
      \ expert by now... And cheerfully as ever, i did agree to join him on his discussions, and thats all i did do about that, hoping that he would be quite happily dozing off somewhere, in a nice and cosy place..However, while checking my mails as usual, today evening , i saw a post from qais, that only mentioned about a link to one of his posts here.... Unfortuantely for me, i found out soon that i was the subject of a post on this public domain !!.... Hmm... yet another one of those tricks from the Shahid Hussain school of thought.....So well, thats how this post has ended up... Qais and I , we are old pals from the AMU , where we were class mates at +2.And it was almost 2 years ago that we met again ,in hyderabad , where i had enrolled for some  technical training programmes in some favourite subjects of mine ( Systems Administration & Networking). We had some nice times there , and in the company of some wonderful guys like Kashif , and his friends there, at 10-5-18A,Masab Tank. And\
      \ among other things, we had quite a lot of friendly discussions and talks on a variety of things, some of them being mentioned here, like the Campus Life at AMU, The 2 schools of thought mentioned here, about The Differing Colours and myriad hues of Life, The experiences it brings along,...etc etc... I hope this introduction helps, even at the risk of having had to write up such a long intro, and having  to slightly bore my good natured buddies here. But as Qais says,  'The debates and discussions still go on.So Who says the emails should be kept short ??? '  Cheers... Riz (15-June-2004)\n\nBlog post 9:\nToday is my Mom-Dad’s wedding anniversary. It has been 31 years since they started walking together on the topsy-turvy primrose path. I sometimes think about the feelings people might have about their spouses after being together for 20, 30 or 50 years.   The kind of understanding I share with some of my friends as old as ten years is amazing in itself even though I didn’t spend all\
      \ these ten years with them. I wonder what we would be like...after this kind of togetherness with our spouses. May God keep us alive and together to experience it ourselves. I believe nobody can understand this until he experiences it, that is, how is it to be with one same person for this long time. It also takes me to another thought, like, our Dads had been doing their jobs at the same organization for last 25-30 years. Don’t they get bored of the monotony, the predictability, and a sense of deja vu ?  On second thoughts, I also question our generation. Are we mad and obsessed with change? We don’t want to stay in the same job for more than 2 –3 years. We want to get rid of our vehicles so soon and we want to changes our houses, locality or even cities like our clothes. I know it’s good to change and 'Change' is what should always happen to life to keep it going but... Should it be so frequent and so generic that it be applied to all aspects of life?   Unwillingness to change is\
      \ bad and unwillingness to stay in a state for sometime is also bad, not in fashion or something uncalled for…Is it???"
    question: "Now, imagine you are the author. Please write a new blog post of about 500 words on the following topic: \"A hospitalized man's life is enriched by his roommate's vivid descriptions of the world outside their window, only to discover after the roommate's passing that he was blind and had been selflessly painting a picture of a better life to bring joy to his fellow patient.\" \n\nWrite the blog from the author's first-person perspective, matching their style.   Output only the blog post content, with no additional explanations.\n\n"
    answer: 'Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room''s only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation. Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of
      the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene. One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn''t hear the band - he could see it. In his mind''s eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days and weeks passed... One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He
      strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said, ''Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.'' Epilogue: ''There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations'' ''Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled'' ''If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can''t buy'' ''Today is a gift, that''s why it is called the present.''

  task_specific:
    scenario: "I want you to imitate a user in blog writing. Below is a list of previous blogs written by the user: \n   \nBlog post 1:\nOn Saturday at a knitting-cool friend's finger-food party a guitar-playing, Beatles-loving friend suggested I do this. I scrunched up my face and then asked why. 'It'd be interesting.' I assured him it would not. What would I write about?   Your life.   Too broad.   What about others' lives, I ask? I'm better at that...other people's lives.  I interview the unemployed at a staffing agency. I meet characters everyday. People don't believe my stories about the administrative assistant who brokered an art sale to the Louvre or the professional bull rider from Mexico who wants a packing job or the breast puller from a major poultry plant who doesn't laugh at his job title. Pulling chickens apart is tough, nasty work.  I sit across the table from jobseekers everyday and I learn something new. I learn that I have two degrees that mean squat. I learn that until\
      \ now I haven't taken any true steps for working for myself.   I learn that I want to share this because maybe it's not so uninteresting after all.\n\nBlog post 2:\nThis month's favorite writer writes: '...Grief ends up giving you the two best things: softness and illumination.'  Anne Lamott,  Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith   These two best things were in quiet abundance in my last interview of the day.   L. was initially stoic, almost grumpy. Long face, long blonde hair. She's a delivery driver. Has been for the past 9 years. She didn't volunteer much information. I didn't want to hear myself talk. So I sat still, took a deep breath and asked her how she found herself delivery driving.  'My husband.' He died two years ago. Together for 20. She sat still after volunteering this. 'I lost 13 family members that year.' I changed the subject to her past employment reincarnation as a seamstress. I couldn't handle 13 loved ones gone. 730 days is not that long. I kept wondering\
      \ how 13 people die in one year, but I didn't ask.   Instead, I asked her how to make a quilt. Seemed like a safer question. Patience, she said. It takes lots of patience to make a quilt.   And persistence.   Those two things will get you through it all, she said.   I'm still not convinced I can make a quilt.\n\nBlog post 3:\nThings not to tell a potential employer... You have several warrants out for your arrest. They are not for traffic tickets. Good news: They are not felonies. My wife is always getting me in trouble. Read: Assault & battery charges for abusing said troublesome wife. Um, who's getting who in trouble? You haven't worked in the past 11 years. You've hopped from friend's couch to friend's couch making wooden incense burners for a living. You see nothing wrong with this artistic wandering. Today, though, you're ready to 'make a life' and get a job. Best long-term goal of yesterday's interviewees: To do web development for Heart or Van Halen. I think the timing's off,\
      \ but the idea's interesting. Maybe she could bring some incense burners for her rock-and-roll idols. Worst person to get stuck behind while rushing to work: Lou, the 80-something telemarketer for a neighboring attorney in this office complex who square dances with married men at the American Legion, likes to tell dirty jokes when I'm covering the phones and brakes through green lights.\n\nBlog post 4:\nGod's Camcorder Last interview of the day, 180 degrees from yesterday: I should've known interviewing Michael was going to be interesting. When I asked him if he knew his name in Hebrew meant 'One Like God?' he answered he did, and 'I ain't God.' When asked to tell me something interesting about himself that wasn't on his application, Mike said, 'I can't split water neither.' So off to a biblical start, we pushed onward. Come to find out, Michael has a pesky habit of videotaping past supervisors sleeping on the job. Smart move if you do the same thing, which Michael did. I asked Michael\
      \ if he could leave his camcorder home if we sent him on assignment. He just smiled.\n\nBlog post 5:\n'Groove is in the heart...'   Is potentially the best song ever. Dee Light rocks. She's turned up full blast at work. The same work where the ladies in payroll, who are my moms away from mom, tell me it sounds like I'm listening to reggae everytime they come back to my little office (which isn't really an office, but there is no cubicle, thank God). Really I'm listening to some lame soft rock station that's on some satanic continuous loop of five pop songs. It's maddening, yet I don't dare mess with the already fickle reception.   No management in the house results in donuts, music and the girls in staffing dancing to a Christmas song at their desks. It's mid-November. Too early for this.    The Onion  calendar on my desk says 'Tearful Hitler Promises to 'Give Peace a Chance.'' Whatever.   I'm just happy it's Friday and I have a ripe banana.\n\nBlog post 6:\nCareer Daydreams My friend\
      \ Kristin rocks. She gave me a really cool book with a phrase in the title that I used to think was impossible: 'Practical Dreamer.' So, before I dive into The Practical Dreamer's Handbook, I thought I'd divulge my deepest, darkest career objectives. Diva-in-training: To obtain a sultry lounge singer position where one doesn't fall off her piano, whose regulars reward her with gerber daisies and dark chocolate and has an awesome wardrobe assistant whose motto is 'More Sparkles, Ms. M. More Sparkles.' Psychedelic pedestrian poet: To aspire to write like Anne Lamott, May Sarton, Tom Robbins, Grace Paley, Dorothy Allison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, John Hersey and Brian Andreas. I wouldn't talk about writing, I'd actually write. Revolutionary idea, huh? Stay tuned. I might just make this one happen. Over-the-road truckdriver: I've already picked out my handle: showmegirl. I think it's funny and clever, but one of my friends pointed out it could give my co-truckers the wrong idea.\
      \ Well, those truckers need to focus on the road and quit taking so much meth. I think there's nothing sexier than a woman and 18 wheels. For the record, that stupid country song about chrome sucks. Think alterna-trucker girl, not Heehaw meets yeehaw.\n\nBlog post 7:\nAm I Mary Tyler Moore post-modern? I woke up at 4:30 a.m. wondering this. I think I'm self-absorbed and highly retro, yet entertaining. Today found me on the Kansas side interviewing, eating too many frosted animal crackers (they're more addictive than Al Green, provided you're addicted to a Memphis-based Soul Reverend like me. I'm sure some of you were conceived to him. Don't deny your love!) and ushering one applicant through three doors to get him to understand the interview was OVER. I was locking the door mid-sentence through a story about how he rubbed a Las Vegas slot machine for him mama and won $275,000. Great, just great, I tell him. Sure, he was interesting, but I learned how he met his first wife, then his\
      \ second wife, that he drinks red wine with club sandwiches, how he finagled 30 gallons of day-glo yellow paint for his commanding officer in the Army by bartering blankets not on the purchase order books (He doesn't tell his secrets, he explained in the interview, except to me, I guess. And he never told me what the paint was for!), that he'd like to work in HR although his last job was supervising mall trash (Think big. I admire that.), his casino preferences, that he dated some DJ from some local radio station (Like I care!), that he just had an angioplasty (four stints) and he speaks conversational Korean. TMI times 5! Speaking of Reverend Green, I met him if he'd joined the Army (what's up with all the former military men I'm meeting?) and lived in Munich for 23 years and picked up an electric guitar. German Green thinks the Rhinelanders are a little uptight, drive too fast (damn Autobahn), yet have really good beer that cures hang-overs. I got a lesson on German beer at 11 a.m.\
      \ No fair. My worst attempt at small talk ever to an applicant originally from Madagascar: 'Oh, I heard something really interesting about your country on NPR.' Oh....my....God. P.S. I forgot to include Willa Cather in my list of rockin' writers I want to be like. If I could be a fictitious character I would want to be Antonia. I'm from the Midwest, so that's working for me.\n\nBlog post 8:\nCourtney Love Gone Corporate   I have a cold. Blogger advises me not lose my job over this. I agree.   So let me explain my intentions.   I write about the people I meet/interview not to mock them, but to describe who/what I deal with on a daily basis. I'm in shock that I'm fortunate enough to meet the characters who are responsible for my stories. Most of the people I meet are 'normal,' but it's those loveable odd balls that tug at my heart...  ...that make me happy to be human and present and observant enough to notice that they matter, this moment matters and even though I have a huge hole in\
      \ my tights above my right knee and several co-workers who taunt me about an inadvertantly revealing blouse that prompts one to ask where I got my 'job' done, that the 5 o'clock whistle will blow, I will take this ridiculously trampy outfit off and I will go home.   And when my work day ends, I want to know what I've done today that involves working for me. I want to know what stories I've sown besides the ones I'm paid to listen to on someone else's dime.   I want to know when the real work starts (when I go home), how I'll use my time and energy and talent.   These stories are just reminders (for me, maybe you) not to let dreams die. Work for them. Live for them.   But, for crying outloud, make 'em happen.\n\nBlog post 9:\nThursday I survived a flu-like haze, surrounded by used tissues and Good Earth Original tea bags. I am alive!  I can kind of breath. My left nostril runs consistently. Why? I do not know. My doctor should tell me today at 1:30 p.m.  I am one of those co-workers\
      \ other co-workers curse. I come to work sick.   I shot myself in the foot yesterday by referring a really cool, super talented lady to a job I've applied for (yes, I would like to trade temporary wisdom for family literacy wisdom). She'll get the job, this woman. She's had over 20 years in literacy and a Masters.   But I felt good about telling her. I felt like there's a reason people's paths intersect somedays. I'm new-agey like that.\n\nBlog post 10:\nToday is one of those days I feel tingly just thinking about where I'm headed. I feel very pivitol, very fresh. Very much aware that I need to hunker down and get busy. Weird. The temporary world is a bit dull this week what with Thanksgiving tomorrow. So here is my list of thanks for this week: *I'm thankful to be home and surrounded by loved ones even though I'm searching professionally and personally. A year ago I was really blue in Atlanta. Cool place, cool people, but I need my crazy family and friends somewhat nearby. Emphasis\
      \ on the somewhat. Now I feel purple. Bright reds, deep blues combine to make an upbeat, colorful girl. *I have some great friends who inspire and move me. They believe in me when I feel pretty poopy/unperky. Believe me, this happens. This list is not all inclusive, but includes Jenna I., Kristin B., Quo E., Aruna J., David A., Benjie H., Nica H., Wendy E., Tia L., Tiffany B., my Carolina cronies, my DC peeps, the Lawrence crowd and my mom, who drives me nuts with love and annoyance some days, but often is my sounding board, kindred spirit and patient listener. *I have my health. This Thanksgiving was the last holiday I spent with my grandmother, Anna Lee. I miss her horribly, but the fork in my heart has been pulled out (I think). Now I feel intense, softened love for her and for my loss. I had some serious grieving to do this year to get to the cool place I'm at now: a diving board where potential's warm waters beckon. Much love, grub and health to you and yours. Next entry will\
      \ be less me-centered, I promise.\n\nBlog post 11:\nTemps are people too. Has my blog been unfair exploitation of temporaries? I don't think so. Heck, I came here to be a temp. Look at me now?  All grown up and working FOR the man, the temporary agency. It's indeed temporary temping for this temp.   Today's interesting thought: As I confronted my image in the mirror at 7-something a.m. after my part-time bakery gig and manuevering a rear-wheel drive truck in slushy snow, I wondered why I just didn't marry a military man or a carnie or OTR truck driver. I could travel and write little missives in my purple notebook and be the happy travel-maker.   I tell you why I won't settle for secondhand spousal living: I'm not a parasite. I'm going to put my energy, myself, back out into this wild-wonderful-weird place, like Gordon Parks says (roughly paraphrased and what I painted outside of my dorm room four years ago):  You have to really want to be somebody. You have to pay for your time on\
      \ this earth.   Just in case you're wondering. Which, I'm sure those few who have told me they read this, they weren't.   But now you know. Now you know.\n\nBlog post 12:\nWhy I Love My Boss. First off all, I am not sucking up. Mr. K doesn't even know how to get on the Internet, but I love him all the same. Let me count the ways... 1) The Holiday Luncheon is at a renowned Kansas City steak restaurant named after a breed of cattle. I, however, pick salmon. Red meat disgusts me. Somehow I can see myself catching a fish and killing it, but not a cow. I think I would run from a cow. In fact, I, the cattleman's daughter, am afraid of cows, bulls, calves & what have you, but I digress. The lunch was wonderful and free. Free lunch DOES exist, folks. Mmmm 2) He sometimes let's us go home early and yet on my timesheet it still says 5 p.m. because he says to put it down. Wonderful. That's totally generous. 3) He thinks I'm smart. He's right of course, but it's really nice to have someone agree\
      \ in such a disagreeing world, you know? 4) He laughs at my jokes. There's something to be said about this, but I think the sound of laughter says more. 5) He knows I'm blowing this popsicle stand soon (relatively) and encourages me to better myself. That's pretty amazing, if you ask me.\n\nBlog post 13:\nI'm done with Missouri weather. Who's coming with me to Barbados? I know I'm a wuss and this is non-temp related and I haven't written in a week, but I don't care. This is the second morning I've been dependent on a kind man with a 4-wheel-drive truck and a chain. I hate rear-wheel drive. I hate psuedo trucks and the real women who claim to drive them. So, I'm going car shopping. Completely impractical, wrong timing, but it's time to say good-bye to my dear, dear friend Burletta. She's taken me to many wonderful and interesting places, but the snow and ice are not her specialty. One bit of temp wisdom for you, just to keep this topical and less me-me-me: Um, I can't think of any this\
      \ morning. But I'm sure it'll come, and then I promise to post it and post it more frequently. It's been a great week, a week of reading two books in one sitting, but I've been unmotivated work-wise. I discovered a great independent coffee shop and my poetry writing group meeting was cancelled last night due to snow, but I'll be back in January with my free verses and baked goods. I need a fru-fru drink, coconut-scented suntan lotion and warm weather to feel excited about December. The usual distractions aren't doing it for me. I want sun and vice.\n\nBlog post 14:\nVictory: My truck, 240 lbs. of sandbags over the rear axles, parks victoriously. Never again will I take for granted the ability to park in my employee parking lot. Never. I am also not a fan of the cop who put a 48-hour tow notice dayglo orange sticker on my truck window when I parked on a side street. Note: Those things are really hard to get off. Mine's still kind of on, with the dayglo orange part haphazardly picked\
      \ off. Emphasis on picked. It wasn't even an emergency snow route, Dude. Chillout. Check-out the coffee shop on Main Street and breathe deeply. I'll bring you some bread, along with the two guys who came along rescuing me with chains and four-wheel drive. B. in payroll things men troll the streets for girls like me. I'm OK with that then as long as they're saving me and being chivalrous and not seedy. Leon Russell is in town. What would I do to hear him? Bake him 1,000 cupcakes. Ice each one with a soul- flavored frosting dyed purple with a music note, perhaps, stuck in the middle. Make him a t-shirt with my favorite phrase: 'Embrace Your Inner Dork...' And then add on the back of said t-shirt, '...& Leon Russell.' Buy him a Diet Dr. Pepper from the vending machine down the hall and Vanilla Yogurt Bar from the office snack box for every morning he's in town. I'm that generous. M-wuh, to my devoted readers. M-wuh, m-wuh, m-wuh.\n\nBlog post 15:\nThat's o-kay! It's the terror of knowing\
      \ What this world is about Watching some good friends Screaming let me out! Pray tomorrow takes me higher Pressure on people People on streets Lyrics from Under Pressure by David Bowie/Queen This is my theme song tonight. Any copyright folks, chill out. I identify with this song. It's helping me get through today. I want a cup of strong coffee, a good man and a new perspective. Not necessarily in that order.\n\nBlog post 16:\nA Year in Review   A year ago, on Dec. 23, 2002, I took a dramatic, windshield-plopping-like leap into my present. I think this year was when my childhood officially ended. I can’t pinpoint a seminal moment in 2003, but things changed. Mostly for the better. Others not. But what is, is.  I packed up Burletta (my truck) Beverly Hillbillies’ style, said farewell to Atlanta and Margaret Mitchell’s psuedo tourist-site home and found myself at my own version of Tara, but only in Independence, Mo. The family homestead was no longer really “in the family,” and Yankees\
      \ had nothing to do with its take-over. I didn’t even get a cool green dress out of the deal. I only had the guest bedroom and pea-green shag carpeting to contemplate: 24 and moved into Mom’s.   It was depressing.   Then I got on with it. Someone I love died. Part of me died with her and then, recently, begun anew. I “dated” a guy I met on-line (which was destined for failure) in March. I lived with my sister and 2-year-old nephew for six disastrous months. Found my own digs in September off a Rockwell-esque town square. I drank too much merlot in Towson, Md. in August and swung drunk on a tree swing encircled by other inebriated writers cheering encouragement and tree-swing navigation tips. I ordered something with whiskey in it to look cool with one of those writers. I choked on my drink. Then Elana drank my drink without flinching. And I think that’s when I realized my new life view.    I want to be able to drink life’s whiskey shots without gagging. Not everything is amaretto sours.\
      \  So, like I did for four years in high school, I muttered my own little resolution that I defy anyone to throw disadvantages at. I’ll shoot you down. The debate-girl-glam geek is not dead.    Resolved:  That I will not lose my wonder as I advance toward mystifying “adulthood.”    I hope others join me. The temporary wisdom revolution is coming. Put down your doubt, your killjoy detractors. Let’s have a drink and find a tree swing. It’s not too late.\n\nBlog post 17:\nWorking too hard can give you a heart attack,  you oughta know by now. Who needs a house out in Hackensack?  Is that what you get for your money? And it seems such a waste of time,  if that's what it's all about, Mama, if that's moving up  then I'm movin' out.  I'm movin' out.  Billy Joel's lyrics in  'Movin' Out' (Anthony's Song)    He's so right.  I'm feeling the lyrical push towards something greater. Will I quit my moaning and move forward? Oh, yeah.   Just you see.\n\nBlog post 18:\nYou can't make this stuff up\
      \ in real life... One of the job requisites for an order: Applicant must have ' good grammer .' Spell check, anyone? His last name was Stoner. His felony was for marijuana possession.  Are our felonies fated?\n\nBlog post 19:\nI just ate mint chocolate ice cream for breakfast. And an apple, for good measure. Eating ice cream for breakfast, I think, is part of my prescription for not losing your wonder. Dig in some a.m. You'll see what I mean. I have an interview today for a grant writing assistant position for a women's shelter. Wish me luck. I would love this job. I would feel meaning in what I do. I would be using my writing for good, not evil. But don't fret, temporary wisdom will still exist.\n\nBlog post 20:\nWhy I need Kleenex for my truck... I've come to accept that not every post is going to include the people I interview because somedays I think I'm more interesting. This morning I knew I should've stayed in bed. I woke up with a sharp ache in my ears, a constricting of my\
      \ throat. It's Friday. I should feel jubiliant. Instead, I feel sick. Largely, I blame my holistic health sister who refuses to treat my nephew's cold. I always catch it. I'm OK with doctors. I think they do a pretty good job usually. So, my nose is running endlessly. I talk like a cross between Kathleen Turner and James Earl Jones, but it's not sexy or CNN. I reached an all time low commuting to work. I had to do it. The alternative was my sweater sleeve. I had used the last of my napkin stash in the glove compartment. My nose was threatening to run yet again. I desperately grab in the pockets of my coat. I find an unused feminine napkin. Furtively, at a stoplight, I blow my nose into it. I think today couldn't start off any funnier.\n\nBlog post 21:\nBilly Squire sings that Christmas or whatever you celebrate is a time to say I love you. Here's one ode. Tea & Matches If you had a friend, who was in town from her intentional living community adventure, and you were sick and stuffy\
      \ and she said she would bring you something Sunday (“Orange Juice, perhaps?” she said), what would you ask her? If you were me, you would ask her for tea and matches. The great thing about Andra is that she indulges my weird requests. So we drank chai tea amid candles lit by a hot pink Wendy’s Corner Café matchbook. We took a walk that night. We enjoyed each other’s company and I realized how much I miss my friend. I seem to miss people more when I’m with them. Oddity #56 about me. She’s the friend I would hang out with in corners at high school parties, refusing to mingle with the hipper, more talkative crowd. Since then we’ve continued to be “antisocial partners in crime.” We’ve rode a Greyhound bus to Phoenix. We took Grandma’s car to Tempe without permission. On the return bus trip I made a 24-hour vow of silence. She witnessed what many don’t believe. We’ve sneaked onto a school playground to swing under the stars. We’ve met each other half way in Chattanooga, she from KC, me\
      \ from NC. We write each other sporadically. I inspect her homemade purse and handpuppets when she visits. She rifles through my CDs and refrigerator magnets. We’re comfortable in our friendship. I love her. I wish sometimes she wasn’t against capitalism and she could work and live nearby. But she’s my revolutionary friend. I’m proud of her. I want her to be happy. I want to hear more stories about neo-hippies dancing to OutKast in trailers in knit clothing. I want more impromptu visits and provisions. I want everyone to do what they believe in. Andra teaches me this everytime."
    question: "Now, imagine you are the author. Please write a new blog post of about 250 words on the following topic: \"The author accomplished their goal of trying sushi and drinking sake at an authentic Japanese restaurant with friends, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, particularly the salmon, tuna, and sweet shrimp.\" \n\nWrite the blog from the author's first-person perspective, matching their style.   Output only the blog post content, with no additional explanations.\n\n"
    answer: 'My Ambassador of Sushi Love   No. 5 on my list of 25 things to do in my 25th year: Eat sushi; drink sake. Mission accomplished last night at Jun''s, an AWESOME and AUTHENTIC (or so I''m told, because I really have no measuring stick at this point) sushi place in an Overland Park, Ks. strip mall with my friend Marisa, of the writers'' group fame, and her husband Todd, who I debated in high school. Both swear it''s better than the joints they haunted in NYC together, and I believe them!   Marisa is beautiful and funny and talented. She''s the kind of girl it would be fun to be jealous of, but you can''t be. She looks like a brunette Reece Witherspoon and wears great shoes. She''s a teacher, seeker, writer and documentary playwriter, and she was more than enthusiastic when I mentioned I wanted to try sushi last Sunday. So, Friday night, here I sit, cross-legged, warm sake on my tongue, with a whole lot of raw fish in front of me and clumsy chopsticks.   Bless her and the Unagi
      she so loves.   Sushi is delish! I''m particularly fond of the salmon, tuna and sweet shrimp. The halibut was tasty. Tuna gushy and flavorful and the California roll OK. Nothing to write home about, but good nonetheless.  I''m hooked. I want to go back. Now, let''s see...   What else is on my list? Suggestions for 26? (It''s coming soon in September!! Yippee!)'

    answer: Sometimes I just don't know what to think.  I got really mad at Mom after school (DETENTION WAS CANCELLED!!) because she went to Burger King with me and then got HERSELF something to eat and proceeded to tell me to eat at home.  Okay, there isn't anything wrong with that, is there?  I mean, shit happens, right?  Boy was I mad, I about cussed her out.  Over food.  I haven't talked to Matt in like, a few weeks and I am wondering why.  I hope he is okay . . . what would I do without him?  I keep dreaming about him.  The other night he died, then last night he was just there and I kissed him but not as much as you might think, which was weird.  Kat and John are getting married in a few days.  I'm mad crazy about John but I worry about them.  They're too young.  And if they're too young, doesn't that mean that Matt and I are too young???

    scenario: "I want you to imitate a user in blog writing. Below is a list of previous blogs written by the user: \n   \nBlog post 1:\nCelibate! Celibate! (Don't) Dance To The Music  This celibacy thing is... interesting .  On my way home from taking the Dog to the Park (where he positively frollicked...jeez, I  love  that Dog), I decided to make Saturday night Fat Bitch Night.  That's right, substituting sex and drugs with food...what am I gonna do instead, smoke?  So we stopped and got two, count 'em, two pints of Ben & Jerry's (Monkey Wrench and Everything But The, since you asked), got home and ordered the entire Domino's menu (well, okay, maybe only two medium pizzas, Cheesy Bread, and CinniStix).  While I was waiting I finished the fried wonton from Friday night.  But at least I didn't end up online/at a bar/at the West Side Club, right?  Watched bad tv, until I found 'The Spanish Prisoner' on Bravo which was fascinating all over again.  Of course, I forgot that I shouldn't watch\
      \ television or movies that might even  remotely  feature someone I've worked with whose career I perceive to be better than mine because they're in the thing I'm watching.  It really made me think about moving again.  If I moved to Chicago for awhile, got back to basics, did some edgy theatre, then moved back and resubmerged myself, would I be perceived differently?  Could I get some perspective on what I'm selling?  Or would I just be running away?  God knows I'm a long way from playing that cop on my former brother-in-law's tv show...but...what does that leave me with?  I mostly slept today, except for an awkward and ill-advised reunion in the Park with the Math Genius (who was disturbingly bloated, but  still  adorable...and,  yes , Allen, still straight).  I thought I would finish the pizza and ice cream and watch Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer be old and doddering, but instead felt guilty about not spending time with JJ and so went to the movies with him after the show.\
      \  Bridget Jones' Diary (of course fat girls love it, she ends up with a man -- trust me it ain't real).  Just before the movie and for an hour after, JJ decided to start on my life again.  I made the mistake of telling him I wish I could just hit the reset button on my life, that I just didn't know what I was getting out of bed for anymore.  He really thinks I've given up unnecessarily...  He's convinced that making one change, like moving to a new apartment, would change every other aspect of my life.  I remain unconvinced and actually got (briefly) very, very angry with him.  I know he cares, and I know he doesn't want me to go away, but I don't think he gets just how  exhausted  I am from the constant battle.  We went to the Renaissance to talk a little more, and I think we both calmed down, but we changed the subject.  My goal for tomorrow?  Wake up before noon.  Maybe ride my orange bike.  Try not to eat anything either Ben or Jerry might've thought up.  Wouldnt it just be easier\
      \ to do a bump and get laid?\n\nBlog post 2:\nBig Orange Bike  Got my ass up!  Got it on the Big Orange Bike!  Biked from the Intrepid all the way down to the Museum of Jewish Heritage and back.  It was glorious!!  I biked past people I knew and people I wish I knew, past tourists going the wrong way on the bike path and even past the Magickal Colorist (although we didn't try to reconnect...guess we've learned that lesson).  I forgot how much that ride opens up my senses.  Feeling the wind, watching the river...it makes all the hideousness better for the moment.  Pluth's back in town.  We grabbed a quick lunch.  Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet man.  Lucky to have that friendship.  The Evil Empire is as dull as usual, but it's all okay 'cause the Big Orange Bike made it okay.  And while it's quiet I can do my blogging and my blogging stalking.  On my ride this morning, I actually thought I'd spotted one of my blog stalkees ...what would I have done had it actually been he?\
      \  Say hi?  Bike past again to see if I got cruised?  God, that's just creepy.  Although more of a possibility than me actually saying hi, I'd guess.  I'm not even sure of the ethics of IMing Those Bloggers Who Intruigue:  Am I bugging them?  How do I even approach that without foisting upon them perhaps unwanted Blog Celeb Status?  And when will I figure out Blogger enough, and have the balls, to link other Blogizens?  That would be SO grown up.  The SF Potential BF is coming into town this weekend...not even sure I think it's a good idea for us to meet face to face, but with all of our mutual friends, I suppose we shall.  Why do the cute, smart ones always live on the other side of the country in a semi-fog of Californian aloofness?\n\nBlog post 3:\nPuffy Fuffbay!  Wow, the Wonder Pup's a year old today!  That means we've been together for nine months.  Adopting him was the smartest thing I ever did...he's  literally  saved my life.  Through all of this recent mess, when I'd reached\
      \ that emotional cliff, ready to clean out the medicine cabinet, I'd stop myself because I didn't want my boy to have to go back to the Humane Society, or worse.  I did, one night, think (briefly) about taking him with me, but I finally decided that was far too Egyptian and would only land us as a filler item in the Post .  And now I've become one of those people with random dog hair on his shirts and a funny story about how the puppy sleeps on my head sometimes.  It's okay, I have love.  When he decides it's a terrific idea to stretch out on top of me and watch tv, or when he comes over in the middle of an unexplained crying jag and cocks his head at me, or, almost best yet, on our way back from the dog run or the Park and he keeps looking up at my like I'm his only hero...well, hell, roll me in dog hair, I've got love.  I also love the Big Orange Bike.  JJ and I let the river run again...besides the great exercise, you get tan, hairy daddies, tattooed alterna-skaters, straight boys\
      \ in suits, Sam Champion enjoying his own weather, happy secretaries in real-flower leis, yachts with helicopters on top...Summer gooooooood.  Fire still baaaaad, though.  Even though we've already been to the dog run and Petland (for treats and a new collar), I'm surprising my boy (do I have to protect  his  anonymity, too?) by taking him on an unscheduled run in the Park before I go to see The Music Man (please, it's free) and then cocktails with JJ and some random boys at Bar Rage.\n\nBlog post 4:\n'Cause Everything Is Rent  Another month, another eviction notice...same door, though.  Does that mean I'm winning?  This one seems to be a Five Day Notice.  Five days, huh?  Five days to pack up 11 years of my life?  Or what?  The same thing that happened to Pozlife ?  Grooooovy.  And I don't even have a Slutboy  to help.  I feel that I've taxed my friends to their limit, so, as usual, I'm waaay on my own.  I'll just negotiate, wheedle, and argue, while I pack up, sell off, and prepare.\
      \  It's just the next chapter, right?  Maybe I'm not despondent because of the Wonder Pup and the Big Orange Bike.  The combination of the two of them have remarkably cheered me.  Even raised my energy level.  Funny, when I was eight years old, I got a puppy and (weird, now that I think of it) an orange five speed bike (that I didn't know how to ride).  Thirty years later, I got a puppy and a bike on the same day.  What exactly does that mean?  Incidentally, The Addict (from whence came the Big Orange Bike) just called.  Didn't leave a message, but he left his footprints in Caller ID.  I'm not going to get caught in that particular detox.  I tried, I was treated abysmally, I'm done.  I've given to that relationship with absolutely no return and I reached the end...sad to say, he's on his own , too.  [It's turned into quite the little Irene Cara  blog, hasn't it?  What a feeling...]  JJ had a comp to The Music Man  last night, so I used it.  I wasn't looking forward to it, haven't performed\
      \ in it once and directed it once, but I enjoyed it in spite of myself.  It's a smart, dated book that went over the heads of most of the cut-off jean wearing audience (would these people dress the same way going to the theatre in their hometowns?), and some of the performances were hardly Broadway calibre (frankly, I'd make a more convincing 8-year old Iowa girl), but I still cried.  And I was still surprised by some amazingly smart, fresh choices (love ya, Stro!).  And that Craig Bierko?  Charming as hell.  And Mark Moreau if you read this, you make the most adorable faces when you dance.  Here's what made me cry the most, with apologies to Meredith Willson:   All I want is a plain man, All I want is a modest man A quiet man, a gentle man, a straightforward and honest man To live with me, in a cottage  Somewhere in the State of Iowa And I would like him to be More interested in me Than he is in himself And more interested in us Than in me.  And if occasion'lly he'd ponder What makes\
      \ Shakespeare and Beethoven great Him I could love 'til I die Him I could love 'til I die...   Okay, so I'm a fag...what's your point?\n\nBlog post 5:\nGoin' Courtin'  I meant to be up early today, I swear to Goddess (does Sturtle have a copyright on that?).  I mean, I had to go to court and respond to my Eviction Notice (more on that later).  But Fates (and 25-year-olds) conspired against me.  Out of nowhere, Kickboxing Boy showed up.  Well, he called first.  I guess I could've said no, but I remember him being really fun.  I misremembered.  Y'know how there are peripheral people in your life that you like but don't really think much about until you run across them accidentally and through some inadvertant piece of information you find out that you're  far  more important in their life than they are in yours?  That's Kickboxing Boy.  He told me he'd never gotten flowers from someone he really liked until I sent them backstage when I saw his Off-Off-Off-Off-Might-As-Well-Have-Been-Omaha-Off-Broadway\
      \ show.  I smiled a sickly smile, thinking back on how horrendous that experience was, how poorly written the play was, and how talent-free I found him to be.  Yes, Daddy had to commit Green Room Perjury.  And there was something of a payoff in having a fucking adorable 25-year-old boy hanging off of you while you stroll to Avenue A for sushi.  But the bottom line is the chemistry doesn't flow to me from his direction, although, damn it all, I wish it did.  Anyway, I could've said no.  After I'd told him he could come over and hung up, I wish I'd said no.  I immediately went to the Cupboard of Vice to scrape together a little bump of something to make me more interested in it all...but, really, the Cupboard of Vice was bare.  From two old bottles and grinder residue, I got maybe a quarter of a pathetic little bump of crystal that I promptly sneezed back out.  Just as well, I suppose.  KB arrived, there was some awkward conversation, some bland making out, and it just went downhill\
      \ from there.  It's happened, I suppose:  I'm bored with sex.  Or perhaps just unconnected sex.  I can't make it up, I can't pretend I'm enjoying it, but I'm also not conveying that boredom apparently, because KB was out of his mind enjoying it.  Swell.  When it finally, mercifully ended it occurred to me that he thought he might be staying the night.  Ohhhh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Finally, Wonder Pup (oh jeez, let's give him an alias...how 'bout Rex?), decided he needed to go out, so everyone had to get dressed and move to the door.  Well, we walked Rex (while I yawned and bitched about having to get up SO early for court), came upstairs, I yawned and bitched some more...hints were falling so fast and heavy my living room was practically a Hardhat Zone.  Finally, KB decided he might as well get home and let me get some quality sleep.  Which I didn't really.  I finally pulled Rex off my face around 10:30, made breakfast while practicing my landlord speech, and, bolstered with\
      \ 2 cups of fine Five O'Clock Roast and some instant grits, I called The Landlord.  I guess he was mostly decent, but the veiled threats were annoying.   Yeah, I know how much more you could get for this apartment.  Nooo, of course you're not suggesting you want me out.   At any rate, while he agreed to take a partial payment for the moment, I still had to trek down to Foley Square .  I hopped on the Big Orange Bike (if there was anyone actually reading this, I'd be concerned about how many times I mention the B.O.B., but as it is, fuck 'em) and zipped down, prepared to meet the face of the Ignorant and Rude Government Lackey.  And you know what?  I was delightfully surprised.  The woman who helped me was informed, pleasant, energetic and really helpful.  So I have a stay of execution, until next Thursday.  I'm still packing up.  In the meantime, I've picked up extra shifts here at The Evil Empire, actually applied at Starbuck's this afternoon, have priceless ephemera which needs to\
      \ find a price and quick, but I'm not so interested in seeing people.  This has pissed JSquared off since he'd planned a big outing for the opening of The Mummy Returns tomorrow night.  I, of course, had been given the honor of finding out where and when the latest show was, determining how many people were going (mostly  not my friends) and walking over to the theatre and purchasing the tickets (with my own money).  All this while JSquared sat in the Park watching the Broadway Show League play this afternoon, then go meet a pal for coffee.  Did I mention I'd been to court, applied for a part-time job at the CoffeeBorg and had to be at work by 3:30pm?  I got the show info, relayed it, and declined to further involvement (to the tune of ' why ?').  Aw, hell...maybe it's just me.  Is it too late to change the name of this to WhinyBlog?\n\nBlog post 6:\nI've been all alone today at The Evil Empire.  Not only alone, no work.  Nada.  No one's even been in my enclosure.  Actually, that's\
      \ not true...the vending machine guy came in here by mistake.  So I've surfed, I've blogstalked, I've read, I've snacked (healthfully), and, scariest of all:  I've thought.  Well, since you asked:  Giving up Diet Coke --  which I love, too  -- has proven to be much harder than I thought.  But I was influenced by a semingly sensible (and damned entertaining)  blog stranger ...and so I'm trying.  Maybe I'll buy a juicer.  Sometimes, during the day, I miss my dog and my bike.  Okay, it's worse than that:  I just heard that song 'Groovin'' on the radio, and I thought it could easily be about me and Rex.  Of course, in high school, I thought Barry Manilow's 'Mandy' was about a boy and his dog.  Muttering 'move it, fatass' just audibly enough behind slow, stupid tourists doesn't seem to speed them up.  Sometimes it confuses them enough so you can maneuver around them, though.  Somebody  Oughta  Beat  The Wiz .  The sexiest boy I blogstalked today?  Why, it's  him ...  Where was The Mummy\
      \ before he Returned?  When I read  this blog , I usually end up feeling like I wanna give him a big hug, and then be his Mrs. Robinson...is that so wrong?  Somewhere along the line I've moved into Junior  Daddy  Status...and I don't think I mind...  I believe it was the sage,  Abe Burrows  who said, 'Coffee is so good, I can't understand why it isn't a sin.'  The thing that impressed the Math Genius most about my last year?  That I slept with one of his favorite entertainment news anchors...  What happened to anyone behind a counter  anywhere  having manners?  When a fairly successful Broadway actress, who hasn't stopped working for the past six or so years and will probably be nominated for a Tony this year is complaining about how much she hates her job, how the producers mistreat her, and how she's too good for this show, how do I gently intimate that perhaps I'm not the best audience for this rant?  Perhaps I'll stop and get a chicken product of some sort.  And then take my boyfriend,\
      \ er,  dog , to the park...\n\nBlog post 7:\nThe Beautiful Room Is Empty  It has occurred to me this week that every room has it's own climate regions.  Pockets of energy and feeling, some obvious and some not until disturbed by cleaning or redecorating, and especially by the act of packing up.  Should've been obvious, huh?  I didn't expect it.  Books with an inscription that make me cry, written by a guy who doesn't even remember me when I pass him on the street.  An old dog toy belonging to a now-dead cocker spaniel, the child of my first marriage.  Confetti from a hilarious New Year's Eve party that was also one hell of a romantic evening.  A champage cork from that same evening.  Shorts I bought for the White Party four years ago from the 'What The Hell Was I Thinking' collection.  A shirt I borrowed one really rainy night 20-something years ago from a friend that left me too soon...the same shirt that I wore back to my mother's house that morning that caused my mother to confront\
      \ me about my homosexuality.  The very first Playbill that my name appeared in.  The shoes I bought in the mall in New Jersey the day I got the call my father died.  It's like some incredibly emotional acid trip.  I don't know where it's going and I can't really stop it for very long.  But it's also moving energy around in me and in my space that has to be good.  Opening a long-sealed window and allowing the fresh air to mingle with the mustiness, but probably not to ever clear it completely.  I'm lucky, I have a big apartment.  And when the Cathaholic and I broke up, it got even bigger (and twice as expensive).  We moved in about 11 years ago, broke up six years ago...I'm still finding his stuff.  Some of it's funny, some of it's sad, some of it's infuriating.  I find other people's stuff, too.  When you have an apartment bigger than  other people's  in Manhattan, it becomes a repository for  other people's  detritus.  Two chairs brought over for Thanksgiving dinner two years ago\
      \ ('I'll get them eventually.  They fold up, and besides your apartment's huge'), 6 boxes of my ex's Christmas ornaments ('You don't put up a tree, so they're taking up the space you'd use if you did.  Besides, your apartment's huge'), pans and platters from a friend's 40th birthday party three years ago ('Just hang on to them, we'll use them for the next party.  Besides, your apartment's huge'), an envelope of mail belonging to a friend of a friend who stopped by six months ago ('I'll get them when I'm back from Hawaii.  It's old stuff...besides, your apartment's huge').  Y'know what?  With everybody else's stuff, plus my own, plus the dog's things...my huge apartment's getting smaller by the minute.  I'm not Chelsea Storage, people!  My heart's the same way, but I'll die without anybody knowing it.  Maybe I won't leave.  Maybe I won't have to.  Maybe I won't want to.  No one can believe I'm capable of leaving New York, I've been here so long and I seem like such a New Yorker.  But\
      \ a shift has to happen and, whether I knew it or not, the physical act of packing up is sending ripples inward, the reverse of a pebble in a pond; an object hits the bottom of the box, and I feel it in my gut.  So I'm following it, object by object, box by box, and I'm hoping for a shift in energy/emotion/direction.  I hope it's enough.\n\nBlog post 8:\nSometimes I feel like one of the Ghosts of Manhattan.  I drift through the Times Square of 2001 and, sure, I see Planet Hollywood and the WWF Mega-restaurant, but I also see the statues of the stage divas of 1910 still peeking from behind that Sbarro's sign and the old subway entrance, now sealed up, that used to lead up into the Knickerbocker Hotel.  I also see a lot things that aren't there anymore, like the Hotel Astor (where the MTV studios are) or the Old Dutch Mill, an open-air beergarden that used to sit on the roof of the New Victory Theatre.  I know that old theatre that serves as the entrance to the AMC Empire 25 movie theatre\
      \ used to be the Eltinge, built and named for Julian Eltinge, a very popular turn-of-the-century performer who performed in mainstream dramas in drag.  I even know where there's an archway that used to lead to a boardinghouse where Valentino lived before he went to Hollywood...the archway is all that's left of it.  I could go on and on...  So it always makes me sad to see a building being torn down.  It's another chunk of Manhattan's heart that can't ever be replaced.  Who knows what went on in there; what secrets were told; what private dramas played out?  But sometimes there's also a secret revealed, usually in the form of an advertisement painted on the side of a building.  It's small consolation for the loss, but maybe it's the Spirit of the City gently reminding those of us that love here not to dispair:  there's always more, hidden maybe...but all of those other Manhattans still exist somewhere, somehow.  Running an errand today, I stepped out of a building on 42nd Street and\
      \ Madison and noticed that the building on the southwest corner was gone.  Wow.  I didn't know anything interesting about that corner, but it's 42nd Street...might've been important once.  As I was pondering what details I remembered about that building (I got my first cellphone there, and once applied at a temp agency in it), my eye wandered up to the now-exposed buildings surrounding it.  And there, on the building that sits on the southeast corner of 42nd and Fifth, high up and painted in big, white letters arranged around a lone window, it said: Rogers Peet Co.  Without hesitation (and to the consternation of my fellow pedestrians) I stopped in my tracks saying out loud 'Golf!  Galoshes!  Ovaltine!!'  And I sang 'Marry the Man Today' all the way home.  That sign'll be obscured when the newest concrete box is erected, but for today, just for a second, I got to live in Runyonland...\n\nBlog post 9:\nUseless Landscape  Did you hear that thudding sound last night?  Don't be concerned,\
      \ it was just me falling off the wagon...  Yup, I'm a freakin' Tower of Jello .  I caved like a house o' cards.  But you know what?  It was really good, and not at all in the way I expected.  I mentioned in an earlier post that the SF Potential BF was coming to town.  This is a guy who's a friend of some of my best friends, we'd never met, but I kept seeing his picture in various vacation snapshots and every time I'd say 'who's that?'  It was always him.  Apparently, he was having the same experience in reverse.  Then eventually we traded some saucy email, then IMs, etc.  And, while I think he's very cute and smart, (a) he lives in San Francisco and I've already done my Bicoastal Courting for this lifetime and (b) he's the Poster Boy for Reticence.  Well, he was in town this weekend, but I'd picked up lots of shifts at The Evil Empire, so I didn't think I'd get a chance to meet him.  No big deal.  As it happens, I got out of work much earlier yesterday and got sucked into dinner plans\
      \ with the boys.  Okay, I was a little curious.  SFPBF completely didn't expect me and seemed really pleasantly surprised.  He's also cuter than his pictures.  So we went to dinner.  My friends are always a great audience, but apparently last night I was Shecky Freakin' Blogstalker.  From dinner we lost one friend and picked up two others, barhopped from Rawhide, to The View, to Barracuda...hadn't done this for months and it was kinda fun.  Ran into people I knew at every place we went, which for some idiotic reason impressed SFPBF.  He was being flirty, but only as long as I wasn't responding too much.  The minute I flirted back even a little seriously, he withdrew.  Then they were off to The Roxy.  I stopped going to The Roxy, Twilo, etc. and the pharmaceutical accessories that go with those places because, frankly, it became boring.  Also, I got tired of feeling like low-grade crap for two days after and missing out on time I could've been wasting in better ways.  I had no desire\
      \ to go, but I was still curious about this boy and whether he'd actually let himself go.  So I decided I'd walk them over, since I knew Derek the doorman would wave us on through and they wouldn't have to wait in that ridiculous line.  Then they started with 'just come in for a little while.'  For some foolish reason I have a Gold Card and I never have to pay to get in, so I figured, what the hell, dance with the kids a bit and then go home.  Hadn't stepped foot in there since New Year's Eve...but it's always, exactly the same.  Cuteness, Hilarity, Tragedy, Intrigue...usually all in the same boy.  But the music was good, I saw a couple more friends who had the decency not to mention I've gained some weight, so it seemed novel.  We drifted out onto the dance floor, found a good spot, and then they all started taking Circuit Communion, popping Disco Biscuits like Mentos.  I was offered one and not wanting to be on a different wavelength...and also out of curiosity...I took one.  Not\
      \ curiosity about what it was like, Goddess knows I know what it's like.  I actually feel that the drugs I've consumed in the past have actually expanded my world in a good way, almost in a necessary way.  But I also feel like they've served their purpose in my life.  So a part of me wanted to see if I was just kidding myself.  I learned two things last night:  (a) while I won't say never, my pseudo-Circuit Boy phase is over and I'm not only okay with that, I'm relieved.  And number two?  Some hidden spring of self-worth burbled up in me last night and I realized I'm not interested in a boy I have to chase.  I know he's interested 'cause, when, after a couple of hours I decided, to everyone's dismay, that I was leaving, SFPBF finally made a decisive move in my direction and gave me The Long Kiss Goodbye, asking if I was sure I didn't want to stay.  Yup, I was sure.  Not in a bitter way, not with any resentment...very calmly sure I was ready to go.  Look, I'm 38.  I've been gay all\
      \ my life and I've been out since I was 15.  I've played all sorts of games.  I'm done with 'em.  I stated my interest, left a door and a window open.  If you don't have the balls or the sense to come on in, then you're not the man for me, it's just that simple.  [I just read that last sentence...is that really me saying that?  Cool!]  So I sit here this afternoon almost pleased with my hangover headache, thinking of it more as the final achiness of some growing pains; the warm-soreness of stretching some self-esteem muscles that haven't been exercised in too long.  Anybody wanna buy a John Blair Gold Card?"
    question: "Now, imagine you are the author. Please write a new blog post of about 180 words on the following topic: \"The author is considering celibacy, but is open to offers, particularly those involving luxury items or experiences, in exchange for a romantic or sexual encounter.\" \n\nWrite the blog from the author's first-person perspective, matching their style.   Output only the blog post content, with no additional explanations.\n\n"
    answer: 'So maybe attempting celibacy the same week I''m linked by FleshBot is a bad idea.  Or maybe it''s brilliant: you know how the gays love a challenge.  So, at least until we see how this pans out, I''ll still put out.  But if you''re offering, it better be worth it.  I''m mostly a top, so big dicks have limited appeal.  However, Madonna tickets are nice.  Weekends away, IKEA furniture, Penguin shirts.  Narcotics.  I probably won''t mention this ever again, but I''m a freak in bed, so it makes my impending celibacy doubly sad and my auctioning it off all the more intriguing.  At least to me.  But I should make gay while the sun shines.  And if you''re one of the Brazilian boys from that notorious fotolog :  Email us your address (please, no p.o. boxes) and Glenn and I will FedEx you and your soccer team round trip tickets to glamorous Brooklyn, USA! where you''ll be guests at the luxurious Hotel Swanktuary with all the exotic Red Hook you and your buddies can drink!  Pack light.'

After realizing that I did not want to talk to this person, I began to run through the crowd. Apparently I did not get away in time because the person began to follow me. Each turn I took, there she was, following. I began to panic, racing through the crowd, I desperately searched for a place to hide. Alas! the church doors had been left open. I scurried inside, with not a hope of ever knowing, I did not slow down, I run down to the basement where I found there to be nothing. A room and nothing more, I began, in a hurried panic, to run back up the stairs but found myself face to face with this person. Now in a state of emergency\
      \ I ran back to the basement and began to claw at the walls in a desperate attempt to make an escape but this task proved useless for when I looked at my fingers, they had been worn down to the knuckles. Now with no other option I ran up the stairs and pushed the advancer of mine down the stairs, I heard a loud snapping noise, I recognized the sound and knew that she had broken her legs. I stood there staring blankly into the darkness of the basement room when what do I see? but her walking on her hands. I froze, I knew not what to do. Then right before my eyes she collapsed, her shoulders had dislocated. What luck! I thought. I realized that she lay now unconscious, so being the gentleman that I am, I took her to the nearby hospital. \n\n10 or so years later I had stepped into my profession of body guarding. I had a received a new assignment. This new assignment required the use of my services as a protector of a psychiatrist at a local center for misguided children. I never got to\
      \ meet with the person I was protecting, my job consisted of sitting outsider her office and to run in if anything went wrong. \n\nOne day while I sat outside the office I heard an abnormal sound. There was an 8 year old in the office and I thought to myself, well what could go wrong with an 8 year old, he couldnt be too hard to control. After reviewing this I decided that it was the right decision to not go in. A few seconds later the same sound only louder penetrated my ears and I burst into the room. As I stand in the doorway, looking around the office, I spot the psychiatrist for the first time. In shock I took a step back, for it was the person whom I had brought to the hospital after she had broken her legs and arms. I took another look to see what the screaming was about. In a rage of mixed confusion and anger I saw the 8 year old forcing himself on the psychiatrist. I quickly reached for my gun and pulled it out, and then unloaded the chamber into the childs back. The child\
      \ lay motionless in a pool of his own blood. I grabbed the psychiatrist and we swung out the window on a nearby vine into the forest. While in the forest we had a picnic and debated what to do with the rest of out day. We finally decided that the best option would be to go ice-skating. \n\nIce-skating later proved to be the wrong idea. While performing simple tricks, a mistake was made. This trick required me to lift my partner above my head. In the process of doing this her ice skate blade came into contact with the front of my face, slicing it open like a knife through warm butter. She rightfully so took me to the hospital, there while on a stretcher awaiting deployment to the OR, I asked for her hand in marriage. Lying in a state of unconsciousness I told her that I had not a real ring but a spider ring that I had gotten out of a quarter machine earlier that day. She, not being able to resist my stud like ways, said yes. \n\nAfter the wedding we move into a pretty castle, where\
      \ we breed pink ponies. 2 years later we have our first child. He is a disappointment and is constantly getting in trouble with the law and at school. One day I decide that I am done dealing with him so I introduce the back of his head to the shovel. Not sure whether he is dead or knocked out, I lay him to his final rest under the cement of the basement floor. There he lays, to this day, undisturbed in his eternal sleep. \n\n3 years after this incident, we make the decision to have more children. In the up bringing of these children we realize that they are not perfect, but they are good kids. \n\nAs the years go on, the children grow up without much trouble. The children go on with their lives and move out, and to no surprise we are soon forgotten. \n\n25 years later, now my wife and I are 102 years old and the government confronts us with a proposition. They are interested in purchasing our land property so they could build an airport. We refuse and the government went on to build\
      \ the airport around our house. Old and senile, I sit on the front porch in a diaper and shotgun in had. I also have a pink poodle that sits loyally at my side. In a previous conflict with my poodle, I had my left nipple bitten off. My wife, who sits in the basement all day with her thousands of cats, got tired of changing my diapers got me a helper monkey. This monkey did all the household chores, and when it would slip up, we would throw cats at it. \n\nNot long after this, we sat in the living room watching the lion king. Now we both could feel the hand of death close at hand and we died of simultaneous heart attacks. Considering no one remembered about us we sat in our house until out bodies decayed and out skulls rolled off of our skeletons. When we were discovered, 7 years later, they could not tell for sure whose skull was whose. For this we were buried in the same casket. Now to this day you can go out and read our tombstone, which reads, Here lies Teddie and Kevin, looking\
      \ upon you, but not from heaven!\n\nBlog post 10:\ni dunno? yea im in photo woo hoo i had to do my biology project and mr dietrich helped me out ha what a nice guy yea anyways boo im so bored i still have to do some of my biology but its not due till the end of the day yea well dad left and im stuck with the grandparents for the week and club tryouts r on saturday yea lindsey baker is driving me and friday im going to the skatepark and sunday theres a show haha i saw tony today YAY! but yea i dunno i HAVE to call gina tonight i havent talked to her in like forever will that was the bell i have to go love ya babe bye\n\nBlog post 11:\ndamn it im so bored! theres nothing to do im bored!!!!!!!!!!!! blah blah blah well i have this damn biology project i have to do but i dont feel like doin it yet o well i dunno mother is here kinda boring nothing exciting the father is gone for the weekend and the grandparents r here YAY! actually no nothing to YAY! about well u no what im gonna stop writing\

    scenario: "I want you to imitate a user in blog writing. Below is a list of previous blogs written by the user: \n   \nBlog post 1:\nSo I was simply on the phone with my dad and I had an itch on my tummy.  I simply itched it when I realized I felt something.  I looked down and low and behold, there it was.... A bug... And I brushed at it a few times when I realized... IT WAS NOT COMING OFF!  I got all scared and said, 'Daddy I'm coming over because I have a tick!'  and hung up.  I scooted down the road to my house and there dad proceeded to begin the tic-ectamy as he says.  The tic quickly came off and about ten minutes later I calmed down.  Sigh... What a traumatic event!  I think I picked it up on my nature walk with the kids at the River Legacy Center in Arlington (where I am volunteering for some of the summer. http://www.riverlegacy.org/ )  It's all over now and I'm tic-less.    FYI. Tick - Any of numerous small bloodsucking parasitic arachnids of the family Ixodidae, many of which\
      \ transmit febrile diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease.  Any of various usually wingless, louselike insects of the family Hippobosciddae that are parasitic on sheep, goats, and other animals.   No wonder I was scared!\n\nBlog post 2:\nSo I recieved a call from Coppell ISD about a possible teaching job at Lakeside Elementary .  I am a little nervous because of my past three interviews being flops.  I am excited though because they are offering me a Second or Kindergarten position.  I would LOVE to teach second grade again.  Say a little prayer for me and hopefully I will get the best job for me.  I'll post a message when I know the verdict about my job.\n\nBlog post 3:\nToday at about 8am I was called by Coppell ISD's human resource lady.  I GOT A JOB AT LAKESIDE ELEMENTARY AS A SECOND GRADE TEACHER!!!!!  Yea!  I will be signing my papers on June 30th at 300.  God really has blessed me with this job because it is perfect.  It's only 5 miles away from my apartment,\
      \ there seems to be a great team of young teachers, and it's in second grade (my favorite!)  I cant wait!\n\nBlog post 4:\nJune 23, 2004 was her birthday and I became an aunt.  I'm so excited about having such a CUTE niece.  I'm so glad she has joined our family.  Here is the link to find out more about her and see pics.   Reganne Watts   My blog won't let me post any pictures yet.  Also she has her own website:  Reganne\n\nBlog post 5:\nThe Big July fourth celebration was held on July 3rd at John and Michelle's house.  It was a great time for all.  I however was not too happy about the part when John and Patrick realized it had been too long since they last tickled and ganged up on me!  So they proceeded to do so until I yelled, 'Hey that is why you have wives and babies!'  Then Lydia so cleverly asks, 'Patrick who are these other wives and what babies?'  :-P  Don't you love Watts' humor, hehe.    Other highlights were the pictures of the family that were like taking wedding pictures,\
      \ 'Okay now the mom and dad and Reganne, okay now the grandparents, okay now the bridesmaids, oh wait!'  ;-)    Also the fact that there were FOUR Daves on the FOURTH.  Dave Watts, Dave McKinney, Dave Patrick Watts, and Dave Greene.    There was a fabulous manicurist and diaper changer, Kaye, who did a wonderful pedicure with red polish and stars.  I hope she gets started on her new invention she was thinking about making.  It was a great time for family, puns, and fun!  Today I have another little celebration with my friends: Shelly and Matt, Laura and Justin, and Dave.  We will be cooking out and swimming at Shelly and Matt's house.\n\nBlog post 6:\nSo it's summer time.  If I remember correctly, during the school year I was DYING for summer time.  Well I realize now that there is no structure in the summer and all I want is to be in my new classroom setting up things or teaching my new kiddos.    I completed my Exit interview with Carroll ISD, which consisted of me filling out one\
      \ sheet of paper about where I want my last paychecks sent and when.  It was 'thrilling'... and Dr. Citty asked me, 'Is there anything else you'd like to say?'  I thought for a second and said, 'No.'  I realized later that it was true.  There was nothing I wanted to say to the district that cut me due to financial shortfalls and Robin Hood.  All I know is that I did my best and what did that get me?  'Let go.'  It's a harsh reality to this wacko world.    Needless to say I'm happy about my new job and really wanting to get started.\n\nBlog post 7:\nToday Rocky turns 1 year old! I sang to him two times in the morning and one time at night. He just looked at me like I was strange... Weird. I also baked him 5 homemade (from a dog biscuit mix) dog treats. He loves them! Also I made 10 more for him to give to his close dog buddies. He gave one to Pascal (dog friend that lives down stairs), Rosco and Princess (my friend Shelly's dogs), Jedi (his cousin), Cosi, Lexi, and Kandy (his second\
      \ cousins), Sassy (Laura's mom's dog), and Roxy (his girlfriend that is a rotwiler that lives across the complex). He is a happy pup!\n\nBlog post 8:\nSo Dave was gone from 7-17 through 7-20 (today!)  He was in Atlanta staying at an 'exciting' Red Roof Inn.  He was actually very bored being stuck in the room for three days straight.  Anywho, he was there because he had an interview with Atlantic Southeast Airlines to be a CRJ (regional jet) pilot.  He is very excited because he went to both phases of the interview and flew the flight sim better then a pilot with more hours then him.  We are all crossing our fingers and praying for him in hopes that this is the job God wants for him.  He returned today and showed me all of the things he had to do in his interview.  It's amazing how much I don't know about being a pilot.  Yea! for Dave's great interview and we'll see what happens...\n\nBlog post 9:\nSaturday July 24th I gave Laura a surprise Birthday party. She turned 23. Laura had never\
      \ had a surprise party before so this was a great experience for her. She had NO IDEA that it was going to happen, which is amazing cause Laura is the kind of person to find out about EVERYTHING. She could shake a present and tell you what it was or just guess about a place that you are taking her by using logic and reason. Her boyfriend Justin was in charge of getting her to Shelly and Matt's house. He ended up just blind folding her and telling her, 'Oh I'm on the freeway.' and 'Oh I just stopped to trick you.' When she got there she was very surprised! She loved it! We opened presents, ate cake, and played games. I used the free evite site to send out the invitations. What a success!"
    question: "Now, imagine you are the author. Please write a new blog post of about 270 words on the following topic: \"The blogger is excited to set up their new classroom, which they have just moved into, and is planning a bear and apple theme for the upcoming school year.\" \n\nWrite the blog from the author's first-person perspective, matching their style.   Output only the blog post content, with no additional explanations.\n\n"
    answer: Okay so I got the key to my new classroom yesterday. Today I was able to move my boxes and such from my parent's garage to the new classroom. Dave was kind enough to help with his truck. It took a quick two trips and now everything is there. The problem is though, that I have to set it up! I'm soooo excited about it. I am doing the GT training through Carroll ISD (since I am still being paid by them and because mom does the training) in the mornings so I can only work in the afternoon/evening time at the school. By the way, the GT training is interesting because mom tends to single me out sometimes and tell stories that I have heard about 100 times in my life. It is still a great training, don't get me wrong and I'm definately not bored and learning A LOT! Back to the classroom topic - I'm nervous because this time last year my classroom was all nicely set up and this year I'm scrambling to even find my room in this new school. I've decided that my 'theme' will be bears! I had
      sort of a patriotic theme last year and this year it's more of a bear/apple theme. So, if you find anything bear/apple-ish, let me know! I suppose that is all the news for now. More classroom news to come! (oh and I will try to post great class stories - with no names of course - but there always seems to be something good to laugh about in elementary school)

    question: "Imagine you are the author and write a new blog post of approximately 530 words on the following topic:\n\"The author shares a lighthearted and humorous account of their daily experiences, including discovering a new store, attending a play, and catching up with family members.\".   \n \nBegin the blog with these words: \"Wanna hear something funny?

    answer: 'Wanna hear something funny? I definitely just saw Beans and Books today for the first time EVER; I had never heard of it until today on the way to church with my sister. I didn''t know it was open either. I cant wait to go, especially having read darling Amy''s raving reviews.   Sorry I missed the family reunion, Daughter and Hubby. I was too busy being an old woman. I found some wrinkles today too. Time for a midlife crisis. Patrick, you have to buy me a convertable. Preferably one that has heat that isnt actually air conditioning in a stealthy disguise. Funny how you and I are married yet counting down the 6,100 some odd days until our wedding... how does that work? Back to the future? Hm. I was talking about flying cars with my mother today, speaking of the future. She said she and her friends used to think, way back in the day, that cars would fly. And then she said there should probably be a weight limit per car.. and then we decided that was probably politically incorrect.
      This was on the way to Woodfield. (That had to be the most interesting sentence ever. Nobel prize, please.) I showed her a dress I found at Marshall Fields.. and we bought it. I really like it, but its more of a safety if I cant find another one.   Ah yes!!! Jekyll and Hyde! LOVED IT! Absolutely amazing! AJ whats his face was... wow. I cant get over it. And I want my cd, dear Husband, so I can know the music even better. Golly... Im so glad I got to go.   I called my brother today on the way home from church... just cuz I popped in a swing cd and wondered when his spring break is so we can go swing dancing again (all are invited, next time I go). We talked for about 20 minutes. It amazes me how much hes grown. Hes a friend now. Its bizarre. All those years of screaming and being mean (from both sides) melted away with college. I told me about his girlfriend Jen and his slacking off in school and not to worry about college cuz Ill love it. And then he told me how he went to the girls''
      dorm to see what Jen was up to and found his friend Beth (my Grove City kindred spirit: met her once and almost immediately started to sing Les Mis with her) blasting Wicked at the security desk! HA! I sent that to her because I KNEW shed love it. Thats another story, nevermind, anyway...  I think Ill go upstairs now because its colder than an ice cube down here. Next time Ill be a little more creative. Is it strange to anyone else that its 10 on a school night and NOW my sister decides to practice her cello? I swear, that girl is crazy. She once, long ago, told me she needed gel pens because she thought she was dyslexic. Ah the joys of being 12, and not ahereing to societal standards of making sense. Yes, one reason I just love er.'

      The review is: These bands are great. I needed something silicone as I''m a frontline healthcare worker and wanted something that is washable and easy to disinfect. These fit great and the colors are really nice.


      History 2: User bought Cellto Samsung Galaxy S4 Premium Wallet Case [Slim Ultra Fit] [Smooth Purple] Diary Cover/w ID Pocket for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 [Made in Korea] + 1 Premium Cellto Clear Screen Protector. The rating is 4.0.

      The review is: I like wallet type cases and this is my third. The other two I had didn''t hold up but this one is a bit sturdier. Holds 2 cards well and maybe a few bucks, but not much more. That''s all I really need it to do though. I miss the auto off/on my other case had, but it''s not a deal breaker for me. This one already outlasted that one so I can''t complain.


      It''s a good case for the price.


      History 3: User bought OtterBox Defender Series Case & Holster for Apple iPhone 4/4S Retail Packaging - Black. The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: Otterbox does the job. This is my fourth Otterbox Defender. I keep buying because they work.


      This is for my daughter''s phone. She isn''t happy because it''s bulky, but I don''t care. She''s already dropped the phone twice and it has survived. A week before she dropped it she wanted the case off, "Mom, I promise I won''t drop it." BANG! on the way to school it slammed down 4 cement stairs down our porch and not a scratch. Her best friend''s iPhone? Well, the back glass is shattered. So...yes, my daughter''s phone will stay in the Otterbox.

Write about 40 words.\n\nHere are the user's past item reviews:\nHistory 1: User bought From the Moon to the Sun. The rating is 4.0.\nThe review is: This work reminds me a lot of John Wetton's work post-Asia.  Kip Winger has immense talent.  I got the CD to save money but it was a bit wobbly on the last song so getting the download might be a little more but less of a hassle to return or ignore a defective recording.\n\nThat said, like Brian Howe and John Wetton, a great voice of rock turns to a lighter side of himself using instruments that aren't usually heard with rockers.  Though Asia did a lot with other sounds, Kip Winger is no slouch with alternate musical sources.\
      \  The lyrics are from the soul and his slightly scratchy melodic voice is in perfect unison with the often complex musical compositions.  Though some of the alternate instruments can be a bit tedious - eastern sounds aren't always my favorites - reminds me of bagpipes which I swear are going to be played in hell so it's a good idea not to go there.\n\nIf you love Winger and banging your head, this is not for you.  This isn't as much of a psychedelic menagerie as John Sykes later solo works but does the same sort of cerebral investigation of the soul rather than the ex-addict and bad relationship themed solo works of Brian Howe or John Wetton. \n\nTake a listen because they have longer snippets to hear if the ones on Amazon leave you scratching your head.  The music grows on you but you have to like a variety of musical types other than straight hard rock.  If you are a diehard rocker then this CD will make you bang your head for another reason totally.\n"
    question: "Write a 5.0-star review for this product praising the album as a standout, with every track a winner, and sharing how you've listened to it obsessively for years, even needing to replace your copy due to heavy use.  \n\nProduct info:\ntitle: Adrenalize, price: 13.98, description: Def Leppard: Joe Elliot (vocals); Phil Collen (cockney rap vocals, guitar); Rick \"Sav\" Savage (guitar, bass); Rick Allen (drums).

      \ Surprisingly, considering it emerged in the wake of both the grunge explosion and the alcohol-related death of Leppard lead guitarist Steve Clark, the album topped the charts.

The last of Def Leppard's Mutt Lange-produced efforts, ADRENALIZE brought one chapter of the group's history to a close, setting the stage for the stripped-down sound of the follow-up, 1996's SLANG., categories: ['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classic Rock', 'Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)']  \n"
    answer: I really think the band came into their own with this one - not a clunker on it.  I have been listening to it so much the last three years that I had to buy a replacement.

      Here''s the user''s persona:

      Here are the user''s past item reviews:

      History 1: User bought HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Gray, Small (Discontinued by Manufacturer). The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: After our baby could roll over, we needed to stop swaddling. She needed a blanket, but the fleece wearable blankets we had seen were just too heavy. This is perfect for warmer weather. It fits true to the size specifications and we haven''t noticed any problems with shrinkage. Our baby will be growing out of the small soon and we intend to get another cotton sleepsack in a larger size. My only complaint is that the zipper occasionally gets a little stuck and we have to really tug it to get it down all the way, but it''s not enough to cause a problem.

      History 2: User bought Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Baby Bottle | Slow Flow Breast-Like Nipple with Anti-Colic Valve (9oz, 1 Count). The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: These are my favorite of all the bottles we''ve used and I just love all the TT line of products. The slow nipples what come with the bottles are what my baby started out with when she was born and they weren''t too fast for her like a lot of the other bottles. And she never had problems with spit up. I also like the shape of them, they hold a lot without being super tall and they''re easy to hold when feeding baby. Big fan.

    question: "Please compose a 5.0-star review for this product about a beautiful and functional crib that's easy to assemble and convert into a toddler bed and regular bed, with some minor drawbacks, such as creaking and limited conversion options, but overall you're pleased with its sturdiness and versatility.\n\nProduct information: \ntitle: Delta Children Bentley S Series 4-in-1 Convertible Baby Crib, White\n"
    answer: This is a beautiful bed. It is pretty easy to assemble took my husband 30-45 minutes and I love that it converts to a toddler and then just a regular bed. You have to buy the toddler rail separately and then when you want to convert it to a regular bed, you just attach the headboard and footboard to a standard bed frame. I do wish that you could purchase some side rails for when you want to convert to a regular bed, but at least you dont have to pay for another conversion kit. We purchased in the cherry color. Its not exactly what I had in mind when I thought of cherry, but I like the color. Weve had it over 6 months, and the crib seems study, although it does creak a little when you try to move it around. We also didnt have the trouble with getting a mattress to fit like another reviewer mentioned. Im not sure if they had put the bed together incorrectly or what. We just purchased a standard sized baby mattress and it fit snugly. Overall Im very pleased and am looking forward
      to being able to use this bed for several more years in all its different forms.

      Here are the user''s past item reviews:

      History 1: User bought PHIBEE Unisex Snow Ski Goggles Frameless 100% UV Protection Snowboard Goggles for Men Women Youth. The rating is 4.0.

      The review is: I got these for my wife, we dont usually wear goggles when we go out because they are restrictive and block out a lot of the view. My wife liked these because the straps were easily adjustable. She said the color was vibrant and pretty. One thing that she did not like was that when she wore her gator it fogged up the goggles and it would let air get through the goggles which would hit her eyes. The lenses are interchangeable but you have to get them specifically from this company. They did not fog up a lot, impressed on that end.


      History 2: User bought Self-Starting Wrist Gyro Ball, Wrist Strengthening Device, Hand Enhancer, Forearm Exerciser, Used To Strengthen Arms, Fingers, Wrist Bones And Muscles. The rating is 4.0.

      The review is: I got the gyro ball because one of my co-workers had one. Based off of the ones that I have used in the past this one is really comparable. The ball is really sturdy, and it is easy to use. The one I used in the past had a string that would wind up to make the center spin, this one has a recoil system so all you have to do is charge by rolling the center backwards and off you go.


      Pros:

      - Easy to use

      - Nice and durable

      - Recoil system built in

      - Workout your hand


      Cons:

      - The center squeaks when it is slowing down

      - The grip kind of slips at times

      Here are the user''s past item reviews:

      History 1: User bought The Wonderbon Chocolate Co. Cold Hot Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Plant Based, Ready to Drink, Made with Real Melted Chocolate, 8.0 oz (4-Pack). The rating is 3.0.

      The review is: This tastes exactly like chocolate mousse in a can.  It''s rich, foamy, and delicious.... mostly.  The can is just the right size since it''s so rich, any more would be hard to drink in one sitting.


      I would love to give this a 5-star rating but they need to rework things a bit.  My cans arrived on a cold winter day.  The product was barely liquid.  When it gets cold, it turns into a thick chocolate mousse.  I''m not talking ''outside for 8 hours in 10 degree F weather cold,'' even the fridge made it revert to chocolate mousse.


      The first one I drank straight from the can about 5 minutes after I brought it inside and it was hard to get some of the thick stuff out - I ended up using the handle of an ice-tea spoon.  That said I drank two cans on day one since it was sooooo good even with the texture issues.


      The second can I let warm to room temperature.  That was also a bit of issue.  When I popped the top on that one, I was happy I read some of other reviews that mentioned the fizziness.  Because I opened it slowly it didn''t make too much of a mess but it did make a mess.  Pouring it out was a bit easier but still gloopy.  I popped it in the microwave for a minute and it was divine.  A quick stir and the texture issues were gone but the frothy goodness of real melted chocolate was divine.  Seriously, if you''ve never had real hot chocolate, made with melted chocolate not cocoa powder, do try it.  Wonderbon clearly does something to give it froth, which I haven''t done at home, and that does really add something extra special to it.


      Cans 3 and 4 went into the fridge.  Which was not a great idea.  The third can was literal chocolate mousse when I opened it.  I had to bring it to room temperature for it to liquify enough to be drinkable.  Can 4 was removed from the fridge at the same time.  In both cases, at room temperature, there were still very thick globs of mousse.  Tasty, but weird if you''re not expecting it.


      All in all, I really want to visit their actual store in New York just to try the real stuff.  As it stands, I think they really need to revisit the idea of canning this stuff.  I''m not sure they have the formula correct.  It really is divinely delicious, and I preferred the cold to the hot.  If you have 20 you want to throw at hot chocolate in a can, go for it.  Otherwise, buy yourself a high quality chocolate bar and melt it in milk.

      History 2: User bought Beyu Authentic & Healthy Yucca Crunch Cassava Chips (Pack of 12) | Made with Sea Salt | Artisanal Snack Made with Sea Salt | Gluten Free | Kosher. The rating is 3.0.

      The review is: Beyu Yucca Crunch Cassava Chips taste great and have a very satisfying crunch.  It was easy to forget that I wasn''t eating potato chips since the taste and crunch are basically the same.  These have a bit more crunch than potato chips but in a very satisfying way.  From a taste and crunch perspective, these are great.  While Beyu markets them as being ''healthier'' I fail to see how.  They''re literally the same as potato chips, except that they''re more expensive.


      They''re called Yucca Crunch but they don''t contain Yucca, they''re Cassava.  Cassava is also called yuca but yucca is a whole different plant.  That''s very misleading.  They also make a big deal out of being "Gluten Free."  Well duh, potato chips are also free of wheat gluten, so this claim is just pandering to people too stupid to understand that 1) there are many forms of gluten and 2) gluten, wheat gluten specifically, is only bad if you have celiac disease or other allergic conditions.  As I have many food allergies, I find marketing like this offensive and based on that, I''m tempted to leave a 1-star review.


      With a current price of 21.99 for 12 one-ounce bags, these are really expensive.  So while they are tasty, they aren''t worth the price.

    question: "Now write a 5.0-star review for this product raving about these deliciously crunchy and lightly chocolatey cookies that are perfectly sized for a late-night snack or after-dinner treat, and are surprisingly affordable at just $0.59 per pack.\n    \nHere are the product details:\ntitle: Goya Foods Maria Cookies, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 32) 00034133, categories: ['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Breads & Bakery', 'Cookies'], description: Goya Maria Cookies, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 32) | GOYA Maria Cookies are your favorite biscuits from Spain. These delicious yet simple cookies are subtly sweet and a perfect option for adults and children alike. Use them to make a variety of desserts, thanks to their unique texture and exquisite flavor. Enjoy them as a snack, with your coffee or tea, or even as an ingredient in many delicious desserts. No trans-fat. Low sodium. No cholesterol. If it's Goya ... it has to be good!\n"
    answer: 'This was the first Goya product I''ve tried outside of mango juice.  I''m hooked!  These are lightly chocolately crunchy goodness and dirt cheap to boot!  Since I received them from the Vine program, I''ve bought a second pack and tried their vanilla Maria cookies (also fantastic!).  The pack size on these is perfect for late-night snacks or just an after dinner treat.  It''s not too sweet which I love.  It''s just sweet enough to satiate sweet cravings (and crunchy cravings!) but doesn''t feel too over indulgent, especially if I limit myself to just half in a single package.


      Currently they''re unavailable but when I paid for my last order, they were $4.69 - for 8 good size packs of cookies.  Basically they''re $0.59 per pack so you don''t have to feel like you''re blowing your budget to indulge yourself.  I highly recommend them!  Try the plain Maria cookies too!'

      \ up stars on the scale of Elton John, Paul McCartney, Bono, Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand for some duets? (Note also that unlike some similar projects, all the parties involved on this CD were alive when it was recorded!) The material consists of relatively obvious classics in standard big-band arrangements, and Bennett himself is in top form at age 80, so much so that he doesn't need anybody else to handle \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\" But the fun comes from checking out how his collaborators fare. The Dixie Chicks provide wonderful Andrews Sisters\x96type harmonies on the percolating version of \"Lullaby of Broadway\" that opens the festivities. The best songs tend to be the ones where Bennett's slightly craggy voice is juxtaposed to smooth female ones, like Diana Krall on \"The Best Is Yet to Come,\" familiar accomplice k.d. lang on the sultry \"Because of You\" and Streisand\x97-perhaps Bennett's only equal in stature at this point\x97on \"Smile.\" Among the less expected\

This tribute focuses on Rosemary Clooney in the early to mid-1950s--so we don't get any of the fabulous Nelson Riddle material--but it's a fairly strong offering. It was produced and arranged by Midler's old musical director, Barry Manilow--who actually dueted with Clooney on a couple of songs in the 1990s and here replaces Bing Crosby on the duet \"On a Slow Boat to China.\" Mostly, the CD is about hits: \"Hey There\" and \"White Christmas\" are done in straightforward manner, while Linda Ronstadt fills in for Rosemary's actual sister Betty on a slinky version of \"Sisters.\" Happily, Midler plays \"Come On-A My House\" down instead of up\

    answer: 'I''m sorry, but I cant share the enthusiasm of many of the other reviewers.  First the good: Her versions of On a Slow Boat to China, Hey There, Tenderly, Come on-A My House, Sisters, and especially Mambo Italiano are very enjoyable.  Personally I could do without This Ole House...it was a lousy song in the 50''s and it still is.  The bad: This CD is only thirty minutes long and has only 11 songs!  I also dont like the song White Christmas on here; this isnt a Christmas album.  Instead she should have done Count Your Blessings and/or Love, You Didnt do Right By Me. Like the song Sisters these two are from the movie White Christmas.  And where are the songs Blues in the Night and Half As Much, both big hits for Rosemary?  This was a nice idea, but should have been much, much better.'

Match the user''s writing style, tone, and perspective based on their previous content. Ensure the new review is contextually relevant, coherent, and consistent with the user''s voice. Write about 70 words.


      Here''s the user''s persona:

      The user is a discerning classical music enthusiast with a deep appreciation for symphonies and orchestral works, often favoring traditional performances with a full, rich sound. They have a keen ear for detail, frequently commenting on the quality of the sound, the interpretation of the conductor, and the performance of the orchestra. Their musical tastes tend towards the Romantic era, with a particular fondness for Mahler, whose symphonies they have explored in depth through various recordings. The user values expressive, emotive performances that bring out the nuances of the music, and they are not afraid to criticize recordings that they feel are lacking in this regard. With a collection that spans many years, they have developed a strong sense of what they like and dislike, and their opinions are informed by a wide range of listening experiences. While they can be critical of certain performances or interpretations, their passion for classical music shines through in their thoughtful
      and detailed reviews, which often reflect a deep understanding of the composers and their works. As their musical journey continues, they remain open to new discoveries, yet loyal to the conductors and orchestras that have consistently delivered high-quality performances, such as Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony.


      Here are the user''s past item reviews:

      History 1: User bought Symphony No.6. The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: As the reviews before me pointed out, your view of this performance depends on how you like your Mahler presented.  Fischer is straight forward but I find his view of the music perfectly valid and balanced, one which gets to the core of the music without a lot of huffing and puffing.  Fischer certainly has a keen eye for detail without sounding fussy.  The tempos - and tempo relationships - are very convincing.  There is weight,  power and angst but it''s not exaggerated as with Bernstein, who makes this music hard for me to enjoy.  Fischer''s orchestra plays marvelously and the sound quality is better than every other recording I''ve heard. No, it''s not Berlin but it''s difficult to get Berlin to play great Mahler.


      Comparisons?  Well, I''ve always found Abbado dull;  Barbirolli too slow and deliberate, and Sanderling too austere.  I also find MTT too full of misguided mannerisms that are frustrating, while Karajan rarely gets below the surface of the music.  Szell is a little too lean and clean for me. Two recordings I find excellent are Bertini and the wonderful Eschenbach/Philadelphia.  For me, Fischer joins these two as my favorites.

      History 2: User bought Mahler: Symphony No. 6 - Piano Quartet. The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: This is an absolutely stunning Mahler 6.  Quite simply: great sound, great playing and a winning interpretation by a conductor who understands Mahler. This certainly beats recent accounts by Thomas and Abaddo.  All four movements have ideal tempos, though Eschenbach is very flexible and knows where to let it breath.  Although the andante is leisurely in tempo it is incredibly moving and never drags.  The hammer blows in IV are like a bomb blast.  Too often we have to settle for poor sound or a dull interpretation, but here we have a great American orchestra and a top recording team.  Don''t miss it!


      History 3: User bought Glière: Symphony No. 3 "Il''ya Murometz". The rating is 5.0.

      The review is: Frankly, I don''t understand all these negative reviews.  This is a fine recording of an overlong monster of a piece. Botstein takes exactly the right approach, making this music more coherent than the competition. Yes his tempos are faster than most but it never short changes the music. I find it more appealing than Downes.  Ormandy also recorded a fine performance if you can find it, but it has a lot of cuts. Telarc''s sound is better than the usual Chandos echo-chamber acoustics. All the complainers above are nuts, especially the one who claims to know the score so well.

      The item metadata is: categories: [''CDs & Vinyl'', ''Classical'', ''Symphonies''], description: This flamingly multicolored, unashamedly grand-scaled symphony receives a performance here so sonically beautiful that it''s practically visible. The work is programmatic and tells of the heroic deeds of a medieval knight-strongman, (translated as) "Il ''ya from the town of Murom." Given the orchestration--quadruple woodwinds, four trumpets, eight horns, four trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, two harps, celeste, and strings--he comes across as a combination of Superman, Batman, Robin Hood, and Wagner''s Siegfried. Leon Botstein brings out great warmth in the London Symphony''s string section, the flute bird-curlicues in the second movement are luscious, and, in general, his leadership has nice forward propulsion in a work that can easily sound bloated. If this sort of huge, Romantic palette is your cup of tea--and it is sort of irresistible--then look no further. This realization is
      ravishing, and Telarc''s sound is an audiophile''s dream.


      History 4: User bought Symphonie No 2. The rating is 4.0.

      The review is: This is an excellent M2 from Nott, though it doesn''t challenge my favorites. Up to now I wasn''t sure if Nott and his Bamberg orchestra would be up to the task of this difficult symphony. Previous Mahler recordings from Nott received mixed reviews, although his M9 fared well. But this M2 performance impressed me. The orchestra may not be considered first tier but they play superbly and I find little to criticize. Nott takes sensible tempos throughout this work and brings out a lot of drama as well as a myriad of details. His subtle tempo variations throughout this work are very effective and natural without seeming imposed on the music.


      The first movement has a good mix of drama, atmosphere and respite, and Nott doesn''t allow the music to drag, although I wouldn''t mind a bit more urgency at times. And for once the downward triplets that end the first movement don''t bog down or sound lethargic as in so many other recordings - Rattle for one. The second movement is a bit leisurely and dreamy but has some nice string playing and it never sounds too slow. The third movement is a bit too leisurely at first but soon becomes much more. The central part is exquisite and detailed and the big climax is hair-raising. The woodwinds really shine here and there''s a nice ebb and flow. The fourth movement is also very good. One sticking point for me in this work is the fourth movement contralto, in which so many recordings disappoint. Too often the singing is too heavy with too much vibrato. But Lioba Braun sings beautifully in this movement as well as the last movement, though she is not a first choice. Some good recordings
      have been ruined by terrible singing, like Litton/Dallas. The last movement packs a big punch where it needs to and has plenty of drama, while the off-stage effects are just right - not too distant. I like the way Nott observes Mahler''s instructions to hold certain notes for the horns, which many conductors ignore. He does Mahler proud for the most part. And Nott doesn''t drag out the chorus parts as does MTT in his recent performance, although I like MTT very much. The Bamberg orchestra plays with the necessary weight and intensity, though not quite as good as MTT''s SFS or Fischer''s Budapest players. The singing is very good from the contralto, soprano and chorus. The recording engineers do a very nice job getting it all down in warm but detailed and spacious sound - no easy task in a live recording. The organ, bells, chorus, and orchestra come together in a moving finale. I find little to criticize in this new M2 even though it''s not a first choice, but I''m sure others with
      different tastes will find something. Even though this is a live recording the audience is very quiet and certainly nothing to worry about.


      So how does this new M2 rank among others? Well, it''s almost as good as my favorites - Fischer, Mehta/VPO and MTT. Normally I like Bernstein and Tennstedt but they are too indulgent and uneven in this work. Klemperer, Rattle, Abbado and Kaplan are good but not top contenders for me. Paavo Jarvi recently recorded this in Frankfurt but that one is disappointing. Jarvi hasn''t quite figured out Mahler yet. I don''t always agree with the critics but this time they were mostly right.

      History 5: User bought Rautavaara: Symphony No. 7 "Angel of Light". The rating is 3.0.

      The review is: I never could understand what people see or hear in this composer''s music, and this CD is no exception. Nothing here that I would remotely call great music, and I fail to see why this weird, dissonant music that sounds like horror movie music is so appealing to some people. Oh well, I don''t get this composer.

    question: "Please draft a 3.0-star review for this product expressing mixed feelings about this set, citing the overly reverberant sound and inconsistent conducting, which sometimes muddies the texture and lacks enthusiasm, making individual performances a better choice.\n\nProduct summary:  \ntitle: Dvořák: Symphonies 1-9, categories: ['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical', 'Symphonies'], price: 62.76  \n"
    answer: Whether or not you like this set may depend - as it does for me - on the Chandos sound. It's too reverberant for my taste and I find, in some cases, it muddies up the texture and sounds a bit like an echo chamber. Sometimes Jarvi is really into the music and other times he seems bored and plows right through it. You're better off choosing individual performances.

      \ Beatles The White Album. The rating is 5.0.\nThe review is: After soaring to new heights with Rubber Soul, Revolver and Pepper, The Beatles journey stalled somewhat in late 1967 with Magical Mystery Tour. Between May and October the band recorded The Beatles. As the release date, set for late November, 1968, approached, we fans waited with a certain degree of trepidation. There were rumours that the band was experiencing internal problems. Would this, together with the death of manager Brian Epstein and the disappointing trip to India, result in another record that would not quite live up to our lofty expectations?  The short answer is a resounding \"NO!\"\n\nSome have complained that The Beatles consists of music that is \"all over the map\". This is certainly the case. There are twenty-seven songs, spread over four LP sides. There are, essentially, four composers and four vocalists. I prefer to applaud the variety of style and sound rather than bemoan the lack of a consistent thread.\
      \ I have never considered that this album sounds \"thrown together\" or \"dysfunctional\" as others have written. For me, The White Album competes with Soul, Revolver, Pepper and Abbey Road for honours as the best Beatles release. Only Revolution 9, which I have been trying to appreciate for almost forty years, and Ob-La-Da, detract from my enjoyment. George Harrison's Guitar Weeps and Long, Long, Long are stand-outs. Paul shows that he can still rock hard and John that he can be a balladeer. \n\nThe Beatles is a magnificent comeback - a stellar way for the band to begin the final stage of its career - and yet another record that earns its five stars with ease.\n\nHistory 2: User bought Cafe Bleu. The rating is 5.0.\nThe review is: This is another inspired effort from one of my favourite British bands from the 1980's. It is chockablock with great songs in a variety of styles. Mick's Blessings is a jangly jazz piece featuring Mick Talbot on keyboards. The Whole Point of No Return is\
      \ an airy folk-jazz political number from Weller. Next up is My Ship Came In, a straight horns and keyboards jazz instrumental. A couple of songs later we are presented with The Paris Match, a lovely ballad featuring the incomparable Tracy Thorn on vocals. This is followed by one of the band's signature songs, My Ever Changing Moods and what a great song it is. And so the LP continues, successfully veering from one genre to another. This is most certainly a record that needs to be approached with a fully opened mind. There is consistency of quality. However, the listener who expects a consistency of style will be guaranteed to be left unhappy at the conclusion of side two.\n\nPaul Weller's abandoning his immensely popular band, The Jam, was itself a brave act. Venturing so far in style from that band's oeuvre could have been suicidal - perhaps some fans would follow - but would he attract new ones to replace those who abandoned his ship? In focusing upon jazz and soul he ran the risk\
      \ of being discarded as a poseur. Fortunately, for the legions of Style Council fans around the world, he did make the daring move and for this we are thankful.\n\nHistory 3: User bought The Dark Side Of The Moon. The rating is 5.0.\nThe review is: I was on to these guys early - 1967 - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn - still have the rather well-played and scratchy LP. At that time no-one predicted that the group would become as huge as it did. Although the album was successful in the UK it went unnoticed in the US. Ironic then that over thirty years after it was released Rolling Stone would have it as 347/500 all time. As the years passed Floyd remained a mainstay in the UK album charts while in the US none of the group's subsequent six LP's cracked Billboard's top 50. This changed in 1973 with the release of The Dark Side of the Moon. Like Hotel California, A Stairway to Heaven and Thriller, Dark Side is much-played music that never wears out its welcome with me. The years come and\
      \ go, yet I never tire of this album. On Amazon there are 1202 Pepper reviews and nearly 1500 for Dark Side. Sales for the cd still approach 10,000 a week. Combined Canadian sales for all formats are estimated at 2 million - in a country of 35 million. The record has just 38 minutes of music, proving once again that we don't need to fill every cd with to its maximum 80 minutes.\n\nFor me Pink Floyd rather lost their way after Piper. Subsequent LP's wandered rather aimlessly, a decent song or piece of music followed by meandering/experimental sections or songs that to my ear were more a collection of sounds than they were music. Picking my way through More, Atom Heart Mother or Ummagumma to find the worthwhile tracks was just too much like hard work. Dark Side was therefore a revelation. The band suddenly matured and the result was a brilliantly consistent album with one great song followed by another. There isn't a remotely weak track to be found. My recollection is that Dark Side\
      \ was a collection of accessible prog-space-acid-psychedelic rock songs far more commercial in nature than anything that the band had recorded theretofore. However, today, if I really listen closely and analyze the music I realize that the music on Dark Side isn't that far removed from the music that preceded it on the LP's that I don't particular care for. A cake is a combination of eggs, flour, milk and sugar, mixed and baked. An edible cake has the right combination of ingredients, mixed in the appropriate order and for the appropriate length of time so as to create a batter of the proper consistency. The cake mixture is then placed in the oven at the correct temperature for the appropriate period of time. Pink Floyd always had the ingredients. They simply didn't have the rest of the equation worked out. With Dark Side the band learned that focus and superlative production does make a huge difference. The sound affects, rather than being just unrelated noise, become integral parts\
      \ of the song. The songs no longer meander, as if searching for a conclusion - five on the album are under 4 minutes in length. The lyrics are interesting. This record was and remains an exceptional, once in a lifetime achievement that still sounds as fresh as the day it was released. Dark Side has always sounded tremendous, from record through to cd. However I cannot begin to describe how spectacular the reproduction is on this hybrid SACD.\n"
    question: "Please compose a 2.0-star review for this product expressing disappointment with this Poco album, finding it uninspired and ordinary, with too few memorable moments, and feeling that the band had run out of ideas, making it a skippable record compared to their other superior works.\n\nProduct information: \ntitle: Under the Gun\n"
    answer: '1980 saw Poco, as a five man band, release its fourteenth album. Whereas Legend represented a rewarding movement from Country-Rock to generic pop-rock Under the Gun was far less interesting and deservedly less successful. The problem, as is usually the case, lies with the material. For the most part the music is merely ordinary. I don''t dislike the songs on this record - I simply have no reason to play them again. Why would I when I have so many other superior Poco LPs from which to choose? The bits and pieces that make me sit up and listen are too far and between - Cotton''s solo on The Everlasting Kind, Footsteps of a Fool - the best song on the album, Midnight Rain and Friends in the Distance -  good Cotton songs - but he had done them before and done them better.


      When I pulled out my Poco records with a view to re-evaluating each of them I guess that there was a reason why, after over thirty years in most cases, I recalled all except this one. I love Poco and it doesn''t please me to be negative, but, this album is uninspired and plodding. It is not memorable in any way. It sounds to me as if the band had run out of ideas and was just going through the motions.'

      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a financially savvy and proactive individual, likely a male, who is employed full-time in the US, and is happily married with kids. He has a strong interest in personal finance, investing, and retirement planning, as evident from his queries about 401K, IRA, and taxable brokerage accounts. He is also a homeowner, having discussed issues with his house''s insulation and HVAC system, and has experience with auto loans and credit management. The user values simplicity and ease of management, preferring DIY projects and cost-effective solutions, such as freezing his credit to prevent fraud. Having navigated significant financial decisions, including rolling over his 401K into a rollover IRA and managing excess contributions, he has developed a long-term perspective, advising others to "stay the course" during market downturns. His investment portfolio has averaged a 14% annual return, and he is mindful of tax implications, seeking strategies to minimize capital gains and optimize
      his retirement savings. Throughout his posts, the user comes across as informed, cautious, and willing to share his knowledge and experiences to help others.


      Here are the user''s past comments:

      Comment 1:

      If you''re taking home $3000 a month and you are living with your parents you should be able to get this paid off very quickly.  Since you''re saying "once I move out" that''s the assumption.  Tip, don''t even think about moving out till this debt is paid.


      It will require discipline and patience but it should be easy to do as long as you stick to a tight budget.  The moment you get paid you need to allocate X dollars to the cards/loan.  That''s the first thing you do.  If you run out of money you eat noodles but no matter what you pay those bills.

      Comment 2:

      Your e-fund belongs in a HYSA at a bank.  Sure it''s only 0.5% interest right now but this money is for emergencies.  As such it needs to be zero risk.  Now, if you have more cash on hand than you need for emergencies, then sure, the rest can go into the market.  But then it''s not an e-fund is it.


      My guess based on this part "I''ve seen a lot of stocks and funds whose annual yield is 9% or more" that you are very young and have not lived through recessions.  Here''s the problem.  Right now we are in a period of exceptionally well performing markets.  The market is at all-time highs.  So right now, stocks look like an amazing bet.  Here''s the problem though, there will be a correction.  And when that happens the value of your investments could drop by 50% overnight.  So that''s not an appropriate vehicle for an emergency fund.

      Comment 3:

      Fuck them. You just beat cancer. You just won the war. Declare bankruptcy. Pay nothing. Get healthy and get a job when you''re ready then move out when you can. You were dealt an absolutely shit hand, no reason whatsoever to let it ruin you financially. Bankruptcy lawyers are not that expensive. Look into legal aid.'
    question: "Now write a comment for the following post: My parents are in severe debt and want me to take out a bank loan for them. Is my solution to their problem viable?\n\nMy dad was laid off in June 2016 and has struggled to find a stable job since. He and my mom live in a $350k house that they’ll never pay off. I’ve told them until I’m blue in the face to sell the house and find a cheaper living option but they refuse to do so.\n\nThis morning he sent me this email:\n\n“I am in deep financial turmoil and need help. My credit is shot and can't get a loan on my own. I need $6,000 for the following expenses.\n\nMortgage $3,800.00 \nNeighborhood HOA $1,400.00\nUtility_Gas $288.17 \nUtility_Water $202.36 \nUtility_Electric $191.00 \nWells Fargo $140.00 \n\nYou can get a personal loan for me from Sun Trust or Wells Fargo bank. I will make the monthly payments till the loan is paid in full. If you don't want to do it or, can't do it, please let me know.”\n\nThe last thing I want is a high\
      \ interest bank loan in my name, but I also don’t want my parents to be broke. My solution is for them to sell the house, pay off the mortgage and get back the roughly $70-$80k they have tied up in it, and use that to rent somewhere cheap. That amount could potentially sustain them for years until my dad is old enough to collect social security (he’s 61 now). However, I don’t know a lot about how mortgages and home ownership work to know if this is a viable plan. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, these are not just one month’s worth of expenses. Their monthly house payment is about $1600/month and the HOA fee is yearly, but both have late fees because they’re overdue."
    answer: You are 100$ correct in everything you have said.  If you do this you will be in the same situation in 6 months except you will now be in big debt.  They have significant equity, they need to use it.  He's been unemployed for 3 years, you cannot solve this problem for them.

      The user is a meticulous and financially savvy individual, likely a male, who has been actively engaged in online forums for over a decade, seeking advice and sharing his experiences on various topics, including technology, personal finance, and career development. He appears to be a detail-oriented person, often carefully researching and editing his posts to ensure clarity, as evident from his edited posts on topics such as credit pulls and 401k provider changes. Having navigated significant financial decisions, including managing his wife''s employment benefits, such as pension plans and 403(b) contributions, he has developed a keen sense of responsibility and prudence, as seen in his careful consideration of the potential consequences of his wife''s job change on their financial situation.

      Comment 1:

      I fell for this shit. Got disability insurance that took too long to cancel after I was laid off and moved over my IRA from Schwab to them, what a waste of money. I''m about to move everything out of NW Mutual when I stop being lazy and make the call to my new job''s 401k provider.

      Comment 2:

      I know what you''re saying with the 800D. I traded it because it was so much of a pain to lug around. I think Corsair makes high quality cases, so maybe the 600T?


      I have the g710, actually made a few videos. From what I see everyone who has bought one has liked it.


      Honestly you need to look at how much you want to spend on upgrades for the old computer first, and if you want to put them off, and then go ahead and create a new computer.

      Comment 3:

      I had an asus laptop. Major issues sent out 5 times came back doa 2 times and issue was never fixed. Was the main reason I built my own desktop... I will never buy another asus product again. I don''t care what division it is of asus it is either.. unit was defective and I swear they never spent more than 5 minutes checking my issues... It was g2s-b1 laptop and would get into a restart loop (would do this before booting into windows).  I couldn''t even set it on a non-flat surface without it restarting. Seriously, fully on a desk or it wouldn''t cooperate. Finally sold it on ebay after I built my computer (loyal evga customer now).'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: GF of 8 months came home and said a guy made-out with her


      It was a Friday night, we were both out, I was at a bar with my friends, she was out with her friends.  I got home at 3 and when she got home at 3.30 she walks into my place crying saying a guy made out with her and that she is sorry and loves me more than anything.  I love her too, a lot, but some part of me just won''t be satisfied until I know more details of what happened.  I''m just worried if I ask her it would push her away, or just not make things better in general.


      I believe her when she says it was an accident, but when she says made-out, and not kissed, I get the impression that it lasted a little longer than just a peck...


      Has anyone had this happen?  How did you deal with it?  I love her, but I just want answers...'
    answer: 'same thing happened to me. it wasn''t 8 months but something like 6ish. I went to one college and she went to another and apparently she went out with some of her acquaintances and she didn''t have an exit strategy if one of them was being stupid and wouldn''t leave... some guy ended up getting her really drunk and then supposedly they only made out (and she slept over). It happened on a Friday night and she came to my college by the next day bawling her eyes out.


      Personally I asked all the details and I think that you as her BF has every right to know or the relationship wont work out. I wasn''t too happy with it and but I just let it go and let her know that if it happened again that it would be the end of our relationship (and it never did)'

      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a 57-year-old woman from the UK, concerned about skincare and maintaining healthy skin, often seeking advice and sharing her experiences with various products and routines, while being cautious and questioning of certain ingredients and methods.


      Here are the user''s past comments:

      Comment 1:

      I agree about the La Mer cream. I had a sample and was totally unimpressed. That stuff is fragranced and contains eucalyptus oil. Yikes! As for this seaweed nonsense! But it''s like the rest of the high end lines. It''s the formulation that counts not the price. The famous Estee Lauder night repair is another one that didn''t impress me. Far better serums at a quarter of the price! There are some good expensive products of course, but usually there is something cheap just as good. Cheap rubbish is out there too of course. I''d rather have a cheap effective fragrance and irritant free face cream than pay a fortune for a fancy jar of fragranced crap because it''s "high end". Most high end brands are far too fragranced, they seem to think a lovely smell will sell the product and unfortunately they are often right, but fragrance is not skin care. Like I said check the ingredients, even if something is hundreds of pounds or dollars doesn''t make it good.

      Comment 2:

      I don''t know why it''s listed as a physical but that annoys me too. As far as I know, the only Elta md physical product is the Elta md uv physical but it''s tinted. As far as I know the formula hasn''t changed, it''s just a mistake on this sub, although I could be wrong. If it were a physical sunscreen which as you rightly point out it isn''t, I would buy it. I use the Paula''s Choice calm redness relief mineral, formerly hydralight.

      Comment 3:

      Vit C is best used on clean bare skin before anything else, preferably in the morning as it boosts the effectiveness of sunscreen. Vit C really has helped me with dark spots on my skin. Sorry but I don''t know about BP, maybe someone else can chip in.'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: Will sunscreen work when only applying once a day?


      Dear SkincareAddiction,


      I''m thinking about getting a sunscreen (maybe Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch?) and I was wondering 2 things.


      Do I need to apply it very 2 hours, or will once a day in the morning at 7 am be enough? The answer will probably be no, but I really only want to apply it once a day.


      And do I need to cleanse with oil at the end of the day after I have used sunscreen? Right now I''m just cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing and I was wondering if this would still be enough when using sunscreen.


      Edit 1: Aah the 2 hours is 2 hours being exposed to sun. Do you guys have any sunscreen recommendations (On the cheaper side)'
    answer: On a normal working day I apply only once. I walk to and from work 20 mins either way. You only need to reapply after 2 hours cumulative exposure. It's uv exposure that breaks down sunscreen, not time. As for cleansing, I don't use oil, personally I hate it to cleanse. As long as you are removing sunscreen thoroughly (you may need to double cleanse, I do) you are fine with a normal cleanser.

      and then we held hands is great for couples to play. Abstract game that hits a cool relationship theme with a good deal of complexity.


      Fugitive is a super quick game one trying to outsmart an FBI agent trying to track down a fugitive. It''s a great asymmetrical style of play that develops a serious meta if you play against the same person all the time.


      Mr. Jack Setup is fairly quick and another great asymmetrical game where Jack the Ripper is trying to outsmart Scotland Yard.


      Codenames Duet is coming out soon and is built for two players if you like the original.


      One Deck Dungeon is awesome, but the play time is much longer than what is on the box. Even after playing a few games, it still runs an hour-ish or more.'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: Making a anime-style board game


      I''m making a board game that combines a few of my favorite games with anime. The game and the basics are done, names are given out already (room for changes). The only thing I''m missing is the artwork for each character. 50 girls and a few guys (again room for changes) - it''s a game very much like "betrayal at house on the hill" meets "monopoly" with a resource gather system. So I''m posting this because most of the people that have seen it want to try it out, so I''ll have a Kickstarter account made once at least most of the cards have some kind of art attached. I''m not looking for the greatest art, but if anyone knows of people who will donate some of their work, I''ll gladly give credit, and if everything works out, a copy of the final product.'
    answer: 'Dude, this is really messed up. My wife is a digital artist and she sometimes spends weeks on a single piece of art. How dare you ask for someone''s blood, sweat, and hard work for the price of a pat on the back.


      Making a board game is a business endeavor. Start acting like a businessman if you want people to take your enterprise seriously. That starts with treating your employees fairly and you, as the entrepreneur confident in your product, fronting the capital to produce it.'

      Here are the user''s past comments:

      Comment 1:

      Don''t go easy on them, but make sure they fully understand the deduction and the things they can do to stop you. In between loops I occasionally ask a vague question like, "Have you narrowed down any of the roles or plots?" "Which goodwill abilities seem the most useful to you?" Obviously, you don''t want to win simply because they don''t understand the game yet!


      Another note: The second script is much longer than the first script. Our game went on for 3-4 hours at which point we stopped for the night. In hindsight, limiting tabletalk would have helped things go faster.

      Comment 2:

      Trust the game designer, and if stuff''s hidden on purpose don''t try to unhide it. If stuff is hidden by design, like totems in Reiner Knizia''s Samurai or cubes in Tigris And Euphrates, then of course don''t take notes.


      It frustrates me sometimes how so many people think they are game designers; they think "Oh we have a shield for our meeples? That is stupid, I will remove the shield." "Oh we calculate our victory points at the end? That is stupid, I will calculate my victory points during the game." Game designers are smart. If a game designer is hiding something, it is for a good reason. Many medium-weight games like Samurai, Keyflower and Tigris And Euphrates are intended for players to spend 15 seconds on their turn and make a suboptimal move based on imperfect information and imperfect memory. Many lightweight games like Exposed and Mascarade literally don''t function if people have perfect memory.


      These types of games are designed to where you don''t need to play perfectly to enjoy them, or to win against competitive players. There is enough randomness in the tile draw and your opponent''s moves where you might win anyways. Trust the designer. Make mistakes. It''s part of the fun.'

    answer: 'If they have Valley Of The Kings, that''s what I''m buying for my 2-player cheap easy to learn game! It plays with 2-4 players, it''s a deckbuilder which offers interesting decisions every turn -- not only in what you buy, but in what you score and how you play your cards.


      Unlike Dominion, every card in Valley can be played in three different ways. Every turn you have a guaranteed choice between deck thinning, utility, and money. So with the same starting hand, you might choose "I entomb my shabti and spend 4 gold to buy a statue", or "I activate my box of food to entomb both of my shabtis, destroying the statue", or possibly just "I spend five gold to buy an amulet". You have a ton of different ways to play the same hand of cards, and the decisions get even more interesting as the game progresses.'

      Here are the user''s past comments:

      Comment 1:

      My raised beds are one foot.  I fill it with a mix of topsoil and compost from a local company.  I use raised beds because my soil is heavy clay and plants don''t do well with it.  The roots go much deeper, but that gives them a solid foot of good soil before they have to fight for it.  As someone else has mentioned, if previous herbicide use is your only concern you''re golden.  They''ll grow better in a raised bed with good soil and be easier on your back, but you don''t necessarily need them.

      Comment 2:

      My first pressure treated bed is four years old now (asparagus bed) and still in great shape. I just put in three more this year. We''re considering switching to cinder blocks at some point, but without a truck the PT wood is much easier.

      Comment 3:

      In my experience, I''ve yet to find any straw that was truly "seedless", it just has a lot less seeds.  For straw bale gardening, I''d soak the bales then bag them in black plastic in the sun for a few hot sunny days.  That should do in the seeds.'

      Comment 1:

      I largely agree with you. But the problem with this is that it does create an appearance of corruption, even if it isn''t corruption. Now people will think that Obama made a deal to get this paycheck while he was president. Or that he promised to pull some strings with people who are still in office in order to get money for the paycheck.


      The problem with these speeches is that people don''t believe that the people paying for the speech could possibly want to pay so much money for just a speech. They assume that spending so much on a speech could not be worth the money, so therefore they must be spending the money for some other reason.


      The truth is that it is worth it for these companies to spend these ridiculous sums of money. These speeches attract the people to their conferences that they are trying to target. And these speeches serve as employee benefits, which attracts more people to apply for jobs at their companies and increases retention. The people that these companies are trying to attract are usually young professionals, which is why these speech paydays tend to be offered to Democrats as young professionals are usually Democrats.


      But because most people don''t believe this about the speeches they appear to be corruption.


      And this appearance of corruption is negative for society as a whole. This undermines people''s faith in our democratic system and makes them think the whole system is corrupt. This is what causes people to believe charlatans like Trump who claim that the whole system is corrupt.


      I understand why people like Obama give these speeches. He knows that he is not doing anything more than giving a speech. And honestly, who wouldn''t take half a million dollars for 10 hours of work? But what he fails to understand is that the appearance of corruption can be just as damaging to our democratic system as actual corruption.'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: Why do fit women get so much hate in media FROM WOMEN themselves?


      Some quotes I read

      "Very immature. Those kids need a level-headed mother. She''s behaving like an ass. How would she like it if I went to her and showed her my three graduate degrees which I got before turning 30 and said: What''s your excuse? Or if I showed the publications in academic journals and the conferences I have presented in and said: What''s your excuse? It would be so silly and arrogant. To each her own"


      "I have never been motivated by images like this. I look at her body and all I can think is "Ooh, I have chocolate cake at home."


      "I wonder how much time she is spending with her kids, being in shape isn''t worth sacrificing time with your children"


      "Angelina Jolie is prettier than Maria Kang and has more children. What is Maria Kang''s excuse for her failure to be Mrs Brad Pitt? What is her excuse?"


      "Ugh. Why is it that fitness groups and pages feel the need to shame and hurt? I get it, you''re fit and hot and want others to be you. Whatever. It''s not welcoming and it''s far from inspirational. I am having trouble finding a fitness page that doesn''t upload pictures with captions that are intentionally hurtful. Any suggestions?"


      "Apparently they believe only fear, shame and pain are motivations. It is like certain Christians and Hell" "Jesus, she might as well have just put "I''m Better Than You!" on the poster. What a joke"


      So that brings us even further down the psychological rabbit hole of people who are outraged.


      If someone was as successful at something as this mother of three was in the fitness industry, such a comment would not provoke such outrage.

      So what gives?


      People with the most rage at this would like to feel accomplished at least in one of the fields society deems of value, but since they themselves do not feel accomplished in any field of value to above average standard it brings out jealousy and hatred.


      Yeah the comment might seem bitchy, but it comes off as such only to the very people who feel threatened by a mother of three having a six-pack. What self-worth does a person have when provoking them is so easy? Exactly. None of Value.'
    answer: 'Is it any different than the men who assume all big strong guys are idiots?


      People like to justify not being fit. And to do that they need to make some fit people feel bad about themselves.


      But I don''t think it is just a female thing.'

    scenario: 'Given a user persona, several of their past comments on other posts, and a new post by another user, write a realistic comment (around 90 words) that the user might leave. Match the user''s voice, tone, and perspective as seen in their previous replies. Ensure the comment is relevant, personal, and contextually appropriate. Avoid generic or out-of-character responses.


      Here''s the user persona:

      The user is a 30-year-old man in a six-year relationship with his 25-year-old girlfriend, living in a small town in North Dakota, originally from Georgia, and working at a college. He values alone time, open communication, and thoughtful gestures, and is grateful for his supportive relationship. He is anxious and self-conscious about certain aspects of himself, such as singing, due to his strict upbringing.


      Here are the user''s past comments:

      Comment 1:

      To answer your question that is pointed at the guys... I personally wouldn''t do that, but then again I would never pay money to talk to someone just for the sake of talking to them because they''re a porn star.


      I don''t think he''s being completely honest with you, I think he has a fantasy that he wants to act out and is willing to do so and someone needs to tell him about how dangerous this can be. There are a lot of men who will do something like this, only to be arrested for stalking or worse.


      This reeks of a lonely man, I know it''s hard to imagine how someone can be lonely when they''re married and live with their spouse, but it''s all too real. He needs to get to the root of what''s causing him to feel so lonely, and someone needs to push him to get into some kind of therapy to deal with it. This is a major red flag, not just for the future of your marriage, but also for his wellbeing as a whole. This needs to be fixed ASAP!

      Comment 2:

      It happens, how long have you been with him? It happened for me around the 2 to 2 1/2 year mark, I started thinking about if my relationship was what I really wanted, but I decided to take the ''wait and see'' approach and everything kind of worked itself out. I would implore you to do the same thing. Just wait and see how things go, let everything happen naturally, meditate about it if you do that, if you''re religious, pray for guidance, see where that takes you.


      I am slightly religious and I prayed about it and got the answer of ''wait and see'' and today, my relationship is 1000% exactly what I want.

      Comment 3:

      She is too immature to handle cohabitation right now and she needs some time to get there. Not sharing the responsibility of keeping a home in order is a huge part of that. This might be a good thing for a number of reasons. Either A.) you will learn that you really aren''t compatible and need to split, or B.) she will start to learn about doing her part around the house when her place is a wreck and you''re not around to clean it, leading her to become more responsible.


      My advice? Wait it out and see how it progresses naturally. I do most of the household chores in my house, my girlfriend doesn''t do much of them at all, but that''s fine for us because I prefer being in control of that, and she doesn''t like doing it at all, so it was a win-win for us.'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: Laterally moved to a new position in my company - they are giving me a pay cut.


      As the title states I have moved positions within my company.


      For some background, I was a supervisor for a little under a year when the entirety of the materials department quit (2 people, a manager and buyer/scheduler). I moved into the vacant roles and supported the business for ~2 months before they hired another manager. It was rough. I only had 4 days of training, but we got through it and I learned a lot. I wanted to stay in the buyer/scheduler position after the new manager came.


      A week ago they told me I had the position if I wanted it, and today they told me they would have to cut my pay by 5%. I feel this is extremely unfair given how much I''ve helped the company by struggling to support 2 vacant roles for such a long time. Not to mention I''ve been here for over a year now and should be getting a raise.


      Should I fight harder for this? I think I deserve more. Do I have any other options?


      Thanks for your input.


      Edit: Had a long talk with my manager and HR. A lot of you were correct in saying that moving from a supervisory role to a buyer role was technically a demotion. So, my mistake in saying it was a "lateral move" because that is not true. I thought it was - everyone told me it would be, including my manager and his manager. Did not get that in writing, though.


      Overall it doesn''t feel like a demotion. I have more responsibilities and if I fail in this role it will cost the business significantly more than if I failed in the supervisory role. But I digress. They are firm in their decision so I will be moving forward with a lot of your suggestions. Thank you again for all the answers.'
    answer: '2 months isn''t very long if I''m being honest. I recently took on another role at my job, I''m an IT Tech and now I''m also teaching electronics, I''ve been at this for a few weeks now, but even if I did it for 2 months and then they had someone come in and take over the teacher role, I would fully expect my pay to go back down to what it was before I accepted the teaching position.


      The simplest way to put it, decrease in responsibilities = decrease in pay.'

    scenario: "Given a user persona, several of their past comments on other posts, and a new post by another user, write a realistic comment (around 500 words) that the user might leave. Match the user's voice, tone, and perspective as seen in their previous replies. Ensure the comment is relevant, personal, and contextually appropriate. Avoid generic or out-of-character responses.\n\nHere's the user persona:\nThe user is a likely male, analytical and curious individual, possibly in his mid-to-late 20s or 30s, who values knowledge and understanding, often seeking answers to a wide range of questions, from science and history to everyday life, showcasing a methodical and inquiring mind.\n\nHere are the user's past comments:\nComment 1:\nA few things spring to mind:\n\n* The characters aren't fun to watch, generally.  In a movie that's all about characters, there was a surprising gulf between them and the audience.  The loony guy and his skid row wife were both such disgusting characters\
      \ that engendered almost no sympathy from me the entire film, even when they were trying.\n* Another uninspiring look at artificial intelligence, which hasn't often been portrayed with variety and thoughtfulness (like in Her, for instance).  Chappie was a fun character, but similarly lacked much depth.  The depth presented was simplistic and similarly uninspired.  Chappie's moral decisions were easy to spot and not difficult to choose the right path.  In other words, Chappie was not presented with a moral choice that would trouble any of us, instead Chappie being able to choose it became the focus.  It's a fine distinction, but important -- one path makes the audience an active participant in sussing out what's the right thing to do, the other is more about the suspense of Chappie understanding what's right, which is less interesting.\n* The film began stronger than it ended (something that plagued Big Hero 6, unrelated in tone but one of the more recent examples).  It descended into\
      \ a shooting match at the end, which worked in District 9 because the entire point was the violence and class struggles with the aliens, but here it felt like an excuse to have a violent, cliche ending.\n\nI haven't seen the film since it came out, and the lack of strong memories of the story are further indications that it was lacking in originality and grace, but that's what I remember of my opinion.\n\nNow, my question to you is, do you want to change your view that it's a good film, or are you just looking for reasons why people didn't like it?  Or perhaps you're looking to feel like it wasn't a good film but you otherwise enjoyed it, which is more nuanced.\n\nFor instance, I have a soft spot for Congo, even though it was critically and socially panned, even to this day, by more cineastes.  But whether it's a \"good\" film or not is irrelevant to me enjoying it.\nComment 2:\nMr Besson, thank you for this AMA!  I think the Fifth Element is one of the greatest scifi films ever made,\
      \ and is so smartly conceived.  It is one of the most fully realized future worlds I've ever seen, and almost everything feels both realistic and yet skewed just far enough to be uniquely you.\n\nHave you ever considered doing a horror film?  I ask because horror has been such an abused genre for the past thirty years, with most of the greatest examples coming from the 70s and early/mid-80s.  But horror was once a genre to challenge great filmmakers into making beautiful art while being terrifying.  Kubrick, Spielberg, Bergman, Hitchcock, Scott, Polanski -- all tackled horror instead of just thrillers or suspense and changed the genre forever each time.\n\nI think you could inject some needed life into a woefully under-served genre.\n\nAnd thank you for your work.  I can only hope my path as a filmmaker is half as successful as yours.\nComment 3:\n03 08 20 42 CMP Boy, there must be nothing more desolate than to be inside some of these craters, these conical ones\n\n03 08 20 50 CDR\
      \ People that live in there probably never get out.\n\nThat reads very much like a joke to me. It's not like the astronauts were humorless, the Apollo recordings are filled with the funny. \n\nWhen Apollo 12 commander Pete Conrad stepped out on the moon for the first time, he said, \"Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\"  This was in order to win a bet with an Italian journalist who believed NASA scripted what they said.\n\nOr the rather hilarious occasion when free-floating turds were suspended in the cabin during Apollo 10.\n\nSource: Conrad, Nancy and Klausner, Howard. *Rocketman: Astronaut Pete Conrad's Incredible Ride to the Moon and Beyond*"

    answer: 'I know this isn''t precisely what you asked for, but when I saw the title I thought you were asking for ideas to use to improvise a tune.  Nevertheless, I''m going to give you the story I thought of when I misinterpreted the title:


      A year ago, my friend, Pete, lost the love of his life.  They started going out in high school when they were both 16, but they had been friends for years beforehand.  I believe they knew each other since they were 5, actually.


      I don''t know what it was about them, but they were just perfect together.  Honestly I had never seen a happier couple, which made sense considering how good of friends they were.  None of the rest of their friends, me included, was actually surprised by them getting together, it just seemed like a natural progression.


      After high school they got into different colleges, hundreds of miles away from each other.  My friend actually shared his concerns that a long-distance relation wouldn''t work, and all I told him to decide whether he wanted to try or end it before knowing if it would work.  Not the most practical advice, but I had a feeling about them.


      So they tried it.  They talked on the phone or internet every single night.  At the minimum, they would text their goodnights and I-love-yous to each other.  During breaks and holidays, they would go somewhere together or just hang out back at home, picking up where they left off.


      After graduation they moved back home for awhile to take a breather after the long years at school.  They decided they were going to get married.  That was a year ago.


      That was also about three weeks before she found the lump in her breast.  A week after that, she got the results.  Cancer.


      I don''t want to go into everything that happened after that.  The surgeries, the sleepless nights, the painful chemotherapy.  Instead, I''ll tell you about how three months into her treatment, when she was strong enough, he took her to Yellowstone, where she had always wanted to go.  It was difficult to get around, she had to stop and catch her breath often, but she said she was so happy to finally go there.


      I''ll also tell you that they got married, about a month ago.  It was a small ceremony, but beautiful.  I was the best man (a title I''m not quite sure I deserved, but I''ll take it).  It was really fun, some great pictures.


      And two days ago I came back home after her funeral and drank until I passed out.  It hurts to lose her.  It hurts worse to see how much he''s in pain.  He doesn''t know how he can go on, and I''m doing my best.


      But he loves piano music. In fact it''s all he (sometimes annoyingly) listens to. I don''t know if you''ve read this far, but maybe you could write something for him?'

      The user is a board game enthusiast, likely in his 30s, who values strategic and thematic games, often playing with his girlfriend. He has a strong appreciation for Euros, worker placement, and cooperative games, with a collection that includes titles like Agricola, Pandemic, and Twilight Struggle. He is analytical and enjoys discussing game mechanics, balance, and replayability, often seeking opinions and advice from others.

      Comment 1:

      I''ve been in the hobby for at least 4 years now. It''s true that everyone has their personal taste and preferences but, like you, I cannot understand the fascination with the Dice Tower. Granted, often they are the first group to get a review out the door, so it''s nice that they get early access to content. But presentation-wise, I find the videos painful to watch, and I don''t really share their taste in games, from what I''ve seen.


      I watch Rahdo''s run throughs for virtually every game I''m interested in, assuming he''s done one. I think he has a charismatic personality and is great at sharing his enthusiasm for the experience while also making the rules and concepts relatable. It probably helps that he has a history with the game industry. I also tend to agree with his tastes more, and I play a lot of two player.


      I also use a lot of other random videos that I find on BGG for inspiration and opinions. But, yeah, not a fan of the Dice Tower.  Still, respect what they''ve done for board gaming, and their dedication to it.'
    question: 'Now write a comment for the following post: What did you play this week (May 29 - Jun 5)?


      Happy Monday!


      It''s that time of the week to share with everyone what you''ve been up to for the past 7 days.  Please feel free to share any stories or insights you may have had during the course of play.  Also, don''t forget to comment on others'' posts; we all love to discuss our games with others.


      The following questions are intended to facilitate further discussion:


      * Have you ever bought a game that ''fired'' another one (i.e. King of New York replacing King of Tokyo)?


      * What was your gateway game?'
    answer: "Quite a few games this week!\n\n**Above and Below** (1x, 2p) - Our first play since picking this game up earlier last week, and it was quite a bit of fun! I think we approached it somewhat wrong, trying to make it a meatier game than it is, when, in reality, it's basically a solid worker placement game with a lot of fun storytelling. A great replacement for Tales of the Arabian Nights!\n\n**Akrotiri** (1x, 2p) - Again, another first play! We got this in a trade and are really glad we have it! The style of gameplay is unique and really presents some thinky puzzles that are a lot of fun, especially since we mostly play 2p and this game was designed for only 2. One thing we might do is take out some of the goal cards (the ones requiring portage) since it didn't feel like those were balanced, as they were too difficult to achieve. We'll see though!\n\n**FUSE** (3x, 3p) - One of our favorite quick games, and it did not disappoint at 3 players! I think we prefer it at 2, just with\
      \ the 2 dice per person mechanism, but overall it worked really well with 3.  This is so much excitement in a 10 minute package.\n\n**Grand Austria Hotel** (1x, 2p) - One of our top 5 games, and it was as good as ever. Amazing.\n\n**Hanabi** (1x, 3p) - A classic, short, fun game that has yet to disappoint. So easy to teach, and so quick to play. \n\n**Isle of Skye** (1x, 2p; 1x, 3p) - Another new game, and one that I can see hitting the table very frequently! It's such a simple game but one that requires tough decisions and a lot of crazy results, as the constantly shifting scoring means you're always adjusting what goals you're aiming for. We really enjoy this one.\n\n**Quadropolis** (1x, 2p classic; 1x, 3p classic; 1x, 2p expert) - Another new game and OH MAN we love this one. The two different modes are so vastly different, and somehow the essence of the game is not sufficiently captured in videos. It's a blast to play and a meaty, thinky puzzle, even in the classic mode (although\
      \ much less when compared to the expert). This is a great game.\n\nAs for the questions:\n* Above and Below replaced Tales of the Arabian Nights.  Roll for the Galaxy might have replaced Race.  Grand Austria Hotel somewhat replaced CoB, but only partially.\n* Oddly, the first \"gamers\" game I played was Ghost Stories.  That was brutal, and I loved it.  Then, Dominion."
